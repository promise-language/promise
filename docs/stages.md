## Stage 1 — Grammar (Done)

ANTLR4 lexer and parser grammars covering the full language surface.

**Files:** `PromiseLexer.g4` (166 lines), `PromiseParser.g4` (492 lines)

- 25 keywords, all operators including `:=`, `..`, `..=`, `?.`, `?:`, `=>`, `<-`
- Numeric literals with hex/octal/binary/underscore support
- String interpolation (`{expr}`), raw strings, triple-quoted multiline strings
- Type declarations with inheritance (`is`), enums/ADTs, generics
- Pattern matching, error handling (`?`, `!`, error handlers)
- Concurrency (`go`, `<-`), generators (`yield`, `yield*`)
- Meta annotations (backtick syntax)
- 31 test fixtures (16 valid, 15 invalid)

## Stage 2 — AST Builder (Done)

Complete CST → AST conversion via ANTLR visitor pattern.

**Files:** 17 Go files, ~5K LOC, 2163 lines of tests

- Declaration nodes: `TypeDecl`, `EnumDecl`, `FuncDecl`
- Statement nodes: `VarDecl`, `Assignment`, `Return`, `Raise`, `If`, `For`, `While`, `Match`, `Yield`
- Expression nodes: all literals, identifiers, calls, member access, operators, lambdas, go expressions
- Type reference nodes: named, tuple, function, array, slice, optional, reference types
- Pattern nodes: match patterns, is patterns, destructuring
- Source position tracking, AST pretty-printer

## Stage 3 — Type System (Done)

Core type representations and scope management.

**Files:** 14 Go files, ~2.2K LOC, 1100 lines of tests

- `Named` types with fields, methods, multiple inheritance, abstract tracking
- `Enum` types with variants (positional/named fields), generic support
- `Signature` function types with receiver, params, result, error flag
- Container types: `Tuple`, `Array`, `Slice`, `Map`
- Reference types: `Optional` (`T?`), `SharedRef` (`T&`), `MutRef` (`T~`), `Pointer` (`T*`)
- `TypeParam` with constraints, generic instantiation (`Instance`)
- Lexical `Scope` with parent chain, `Universe` scope with built-in primitives and generic types
- Four-struct placement model (`value`, `instance`, `variant`, `type`)

## Stage 4 — Semantic Analysis (Done)

Four-pass analysis: declare → define → check → verify.

**Files:** 12 Go files, ~3.5K LOC, 67 tests

- **Pass 1 (declare):** Registers all type/enum/func names into file scope with forward-reference support
- **Pass 2 (define):** Resolves parent types, fields, method signatures, type parameter constraints; populates `Named` and `Enum` structures
- **Pass 3 (check):** Type-checks function/method bodies
- **Pass 4 (verify):** Missing-return analysis for non-void functions/methods
- Type inference for `:=` declarations
- Expression type checking: literals, identifiers, binary/unary ops, calls, member access, indexing, optional chaining, `is` expressions, casts, error propagation/unwrap/handlers, if/match expressions, lambdas, go expressions, unsafe blocks
- Statement checking: var decls (typed/inferred/destructure), assignments (simple + compound), return, raise, if (regular + unwrap), while (regular + unwrap), for-in, classic for, infinite loops, break/continue validation, yield/yield*
- Constructor calls with named field validation
- Enum variant access and constructor signatures
- Operator dispatch via method lookup on named types
- **Map literals** resolve to `Map[K, V]` type with key/value consistency checking
- **Range operators** (`..`, `..=`) resolve to `Range` type
- **Go expressions** resolve to `Task[T]` with inner type inference
- **Receive operator** (`<-`) extracts `T` from `Task[T]` or `Channel[T]`
- **Map indexing** returns `V?` (optional) for `Map[K, V]`
- **For-in** supports `Slice`, `Array`, `Map`, `Range`, and `String` iteration
- **Match exhaustiveness** checking for enum types (variant coverage) and non-enum types (wildcard required)
- **Missing return** detection across if/else chains, match expressions, and infinite loops
- Error reporting with source positions

## Stage 5a — Generic Type Substitution (Done)

Type substitution engine and integration into the semantic checker.

**Files:** `types/subst.go` (new), updates to `sema/expr.go`, `sema/resolve.go`, `sema/stmt.go`, `sema/exhaust.go`, `sema/info.go`

- **Substitution engine** (`types/subst.go`): `Substitute(typ, subst)` recursively replaces TypeParam with concrete types across all type kinds (Named, Enum, Instance, Signature, Optional, Ref, Pointer, Tuple, Array, Slice, Map)
- **Field access on Instance**: `box.value` where `box: Box[int]` resolves `T` → `int` via substitution
- **Method calls on Instance**: method signatures substituted — params and return types use concrete types
- **Constructor calls on Instance**: `Box[int](value: 42)` validates field types with substitution
- **Operator dispatch on Instance**: binary/unary operators resolved through origin type with substitution
- **Constraint validation**: type arguments checked against TypeParam constraints at instantiation
- **Expression-context instantiation**: `Box[int]` in expression context (parsed as IndexExpr) reinterpreted as generic instantiation for single-type-arg generics
- **Instance tracking**: `Info.Instances` records all concrete instantiations for later monomorphization
- **Exhaustiveness for generic enums**: `Option[int]` match checks work via Instance → Enum extraction
- **Optional chaining on Instance**: `box?.value` resolves member through substitution
- **For-in on Iter/Stream instances**: `Iter[T]` iteration yields `T`
- **Known limitation**: multi-arg generics (e.g., `Pair[int, string]`) only work in type annotation position (function params, variable types), not in expression context — grammar allows only single expression inside `[]`

## Stage 5b — Sema Completion (Done)

Completes remaining semantic analysis features before ownership checking.

**Files:** Updates to `sema/expr.go`, `sema/check.go`, `sema/decl.go`, `sema/resolve.go`, `sema/builtins.go`, `types/typeparam.go`, `types/equal.go`, `types/object.go`; ~23 new tests

- **Match pattern bindings**: `Some(v) => v` works — scope opened per arm, bindings inserted from ShortDestructure/EnumDestructure/Name/TypeBinding patterns. For generic enum Instance subjects, variant field types are substituted via `BuildSubstMap`.
- **Unreachable code detection**: `checkBlock` tracks dead-code state — statements after `return`, `raise`, `break`, `continue` flagged as unreachable. Recognizes if/else where both branches exit, exhaustive match with all arms exiting, and infinite loops without break.
- **Multi-constraint resolution**: `T: A + B` fully supported — `TypeParam.constraints []Type` stores all constraints, `resolveTypeParamConstraints` resolves the full constraint list, `validateConstraints` checks type args against ALL constraints, `AssignableTo` allows TypeParam assignment to any of its constraints.
- **Iter[T] and Stream[T] abstract methods**: `Iter[T].next() T?` and `Stream[T].next() Task[T?]` populated via `populateIterStream()` in builtins — enables iteration protocol interface checking.
- **Use declaration placeholders**: `Module` object type added, `file.Uses` processed in Pass 1 (alias reserved in scope), bare module reference reports "module not loaded" error. Actual module loading deferred to Stage 9.

## Stage 6 — Borrow Checker (Planned)

Ownership and lifetime analysis.

- Move semantics: track ownership transfers, error on use-after-move
- Borrow rules: at most one `~` (mutable) OR any number of `&` (shared) at a time
- Lifetime inference: determine reference validity scopes
- Lifetime elision rules (function params → result)
- Validate raw pointer (`*`) usage only inside `unsafe` blocks
- Integration with sema pass 3 (ownership errors alongside type errors)

## Stage 7 — Meta Annotations (Planned)

Process and validate meta annotations.

- Built-in metas: `abstract`, `native`, `raw`, `value`, `instance`, `variant`, `type`, `doc`, `deprecated`, `test`, `inline`, `packed`
- Validate meta targets (e.g. `abstract` only on methods, `raw` only on fields)
- Extract `doc` annotations into documentation model
- User-defined meta support (custom annotations that survive to codegen)

## Stage 8 — Code Generation (Planned)

LLVM IR generation from type-checked AST.

- Four-struct memory layout (value/instance/variant/type structs)
- Vtable generation and dispatch
- Ownership-aware memory management (stack vs heap, automatic free)
- Generic monomorphization at IR level
- Error handling codegen (dual-return `(value, error)`)
- Concurrency runtime integration (goroutine scheduling, channels)
- String interpolation lowering
- Operator overloading dispatch

## Stage 9 — Module System (Planned)

Module resolution and dependency management.

- URL-based module identity with version in path
- `use alias "url"` import processing
- Dependency graph construction from source
- Flat directory layout (no required `src/`)
- Cycle detection

## Stage 10 — CLI (Planned)

Full command-line interface.

- `promise build` — compile to binary
- `promise run` — compile and execute
- `promise check` — type-check only (exists as prototype)
- `promise test` — discover and run `test` meta-annotated functions
- `promise fmt` — code formatter

## Stage 11 — Package Manager (Planned)

Dependency fetching and resolution.

- Fetch from git/HTTP URLs
- Lockfile generation and deterministic builds
- Diamond dependency resolution
- Cache management
