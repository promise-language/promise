---

## Stage 1 — Grammar (Done)

- 31 test fixtures (16 valid, 15 invalid)

## Stage 2 — AST Builder (Done)

Complete CST → AST conversion via ANTLR visitor pattern.

**Files:** 17 Go files, ~5K LOC, 2163 lines of tests

- Declaration nodes: `TypeDecl`, `EnumDecl`, `FuncDecl`
- Statement nodes: `VarDecl`, `Assignment`, `Return`, `Raise`, `If`, `For`, `While`, `Match`, `Yield`
- Expression nodes: all literals, identifiers, calls, member access, operators, lambdas, go expressions
- Type reference nodes: named, tuple, function, array, slice, optional, reference types
- Pattern nodes: match patterns, is patterns, destructuring
- Source position tracking, AST pretty-printer

## Stage 3 — Type System (Done)

Core type representations and scope management.

**Files:** 14 Go files, ~2.2K LOC, 1100 lines of tests

- `Named` types with fields, methods, multiple inheritance, abstract tracking
- `Enum` types with variants (positional/named fields), generic support
- `Signature` function types with receiver, params, result, error flag
- Container types: `Tuple`, `Array`, `Slice`, `Map`
- Reference types: `Optional` (`T?`), `SharedRef` (`T&`), `MutRef` (`T~`), `Pointer` (`T*`)
- `TypeParam` with constraints, generic instantiation (`Instance`)
- Lexical `Scope` with parent chain, `Universe` scope with built-in primitives and generic types
- Four-struct placement model (`value`, `instance`, `variant`, `type`)

## Stage 4 — Semantic Analysis (Done)

Four-pass analysis: declare → define → check → verify.

**Files:** 12 Go files, ~3.5K LOC, 67 tests

- **Pass 1 (declare):** Registers all type/enum/func names into file scope with forward-reference support
- **Pass 2 (define):** Resolves parent types, fields, method signatures, type parameter constraints; populates `Named` and `Enum` structures
- **Pass 3 (check):** Type-checks function/method bodies
- **Pass 4 (verify):** Missing-return analysis for non-void functions/methods
- Type inference for `:=` declarations
- Expression type checking: literals, identifiers, binary/unary ops, calls, member access, indexing, optional chaining, `is` expressions, casts, error propagation/unwrap/handlers, if/match expressions, lambdas, go expressions, unsafe blocks
- Statement checking: var decls (typed/inferred/destructure), assignments (simple + compound), return, raise, if (regular + unwrap), while (regular + unwrap), for-in, classic for, infinite loops, break/continue validation, yield/yield*
- Constructor calls with named field validation
- Enum variant access and constructor signatures
- Operator dispatch via method lookup on named types
- **Map literals** resolve to `map[K, V]` type with key/value consistency checking
- **Range operators** (`..`, `..=`) resolve to `range` type
- **Go expressions** resolve to `task[T]` with inner type inference
- **Receive operator** (`<-`) extracts `T` from `task[T]` or `channel[T]`
- **Map indexing** returns `V?` (optional) for `map[K, V]`
- **For-in** supports `slice`, array, `map`, `range`, `string`, and `channel[T]` iteration
- **Match exhaustiveness** checking for enum types (variant coverage) and non-enum types (wildcard required)
- **Missing return** detection across if/else chains, match expressions, and infinite loops
- Error reporting with source positions

---

## Stage 5a — Generic Type Substitution (Done)

Type substitution engine and integration into the semantic checker.

**Files:** `types/subst.go` (new), updates to `sema/expr.go`, `sema/resolve.go`, `sema/stmt.go`, `sema/exhaust.go`, `sema/info.go`

- **Substitution engine** (`types/subst.go`): `Substitute(typ, subst)` recursively replaces TypeParam with concrete types across all type kinds (Named, Enum, Instance, Signature, Optional, Ref, Pointer, Tuple, Array, Slice, Map)
- **Field access on Instance**: `box.value` where `box: Box[int]` resolves `T` → `int` via substitution
- **Method calls on Instance**: method signatures substituted — params and return types use concrete types
- **Constructor calls on Instance**: `Box[int](value: 42)` validates field types with substitution
- **Operator dispatch on Instance**: binary/unary operators resolved through origin type with substitution
- **Constraint validation**: type arguments checked against TypeParam constraints at instantiation
- **Expression-context instantiation**: `Box[int]` in expression context (parsed as IndexExpr) reinterpreted as generic instantiation for single-type-arg generics
- **Instance tracking**: `Info.Instances` records all concrete instantiations for later monomorphization
- **Exhaustiveness for generic enums**: `Option[int]` match checks work via Instance → Enum extraction
- **Optional chaining on Instance**: `box?.value` resolves member through substitution
- **For-in on iter/stream instances**: `iter[T]` iteration yields `T`
- **Known limitation**: multi-arg generics (e.g., `Pair[int, string]`) only work in type annotation position (function params, variable types), not in expression context — grammar allows only single expression inside `[]`

---

## Stage 5b — Sema Completion (Done)

Completes remaining semantic analysis features before ownership checking.

**Files:** Updates to `sema/expr.go`, `sema/check.go`, `sema/decl.go`, `sema/resolve.go`, `sema/builtins.go`, `types/typeparam.go`, `types/equal.go`, `types/object.go`; ~23 new tests

- **Match pattern bindings**: `Some(v) => v` works — scope opened per arm, bindings inserted from ShortDestructure/EnumDestructure/Name/TypeBinding patterns. For generic enum Instance subjects, variant field types are substituted via `BuildSubstMap`.
- **Unreachable code detection**: `checkBlock` tracks dead-code state — statements after `return`, `raise`, `break`, `continue` flagged as unreachable. Recognizes if/else where both branches exit, exhaustive match with all arms exiting, and infinite loops without break.
- **Multi-constraint resolution**: `T: A + B` fully supported — `TypeParam.constraints []Type` stores all constraints, `resolveTypeParamConstraints` resolves the full constraint list, `validateConstraints` checks type args against ALL constraints, `AssignableTo` allows TypeParam assignment to any of its constraints.
- **iter[T] and stream[T] abstract methods**: `iter[T].next() T?` and `stream[T].next() task[T?]` populated via `populateIterStream()` in builtins — enables iteration protocol interface checking.
- **Use declaration placeholders**: `Module` object type added, `file.Uses` processed in Pass 1 (alias reserved in scope), bare module reference reports "module not loaded" error. Actual module loading deferred to Stage 9.

---

## Stage 6a — Move Semantics & Ownership (Done)

Separate post-sema pass for ownership analysis.

**Files:** 7 Go files in `compiler/internal/ownership/`, ~790 LOC + 775 LOC tests, 44 tests (81% coverage)

- **Move tracking**: every value has one owner; assignment, function call (value params), constructor args, and return all transfer ownership. Use-after-move reported with source position.
- **Copy exemption**: primitives (`int`, `bool`, `f64`, `char`, `none`, `void`, all sized ints/floats) and references (`&T`, `~T`) are implicitly copied — never moved.
- **Resurrection**: assigning to a moved variable restores it to `Owned` state.
- **Conservative control flow**: if/else uses state merge (moved in either branch = moved after). Loops merge loop-body state with pre-loop state. Match merges all arm states.
- **Borrow conflict detection**: at call sites, detects when the same variable is passed as `~` (mutable borrow) alongside any other borrow. Multiple shared borrows OK.
- **Unsafe pointer validation**: `TypedVarDecl` with pointer type ref (`T*`) outside `unsafe` block reports error.
- **CLI integration**: ownership errors reported after sema in `--check` mode.
- **Known limitations**: pointer value construction isn't sema-supported (pointer tests use direct AST construction). Implicit borrow coercion addressed in Stage 6b.

---

## Stage 6b — Borrow Tracking & Return Safety (Done)

Cross-statement borrow tracking, implicit borrow coercion, and return reference safety.

**Files:** New `ownership/borrow.go` (~155 LOC); updates to `ownership/check.go`, `ownership/expr.go`, `ownership/stmt.go`, `types/equal.go`; 21 new ownership tests, 8 new types tests

- **Implicit borrow coercion**: `AssignableTo` extended with three rules — `T` → `T&` (shared), `T` → `T~` (mutable), `T~` → `T&` (mut-to-shared downgrade). Uses recursive `AssignableTo` for inheritance compatibility.
- **BorrowSet data structure**: tracks active borrows orthogonally to move state. Each `Borrow` records origin variable, kind (shared/mutable), borrower variable (empty for call-scoped), and source position. All methods nil-safe for backward compatibility.
- **Call-scoped borrows**: passing a variable to a borrow parameter (`string &s`, `string ~s`) creates a borrow that expires at statement boundary. Sequential borrows of the same variable work correctly.
- **Variable-scoped borrows**: when a function returning a ref type (`string&`, `string~`) has its result stored in a variable, pending call-scoped borrows are promoted to variable-scoped. The borrow persists until the borrower variable is reassigned or goes out of scope.
- **Move-while-borrowed detection**: `tryMove` checks for active borrows before marking a variable as moved.
- **Assignment-while-borrowed detection**: reassigning a borrowed-from variable reports an error. Reassigning a borrower variable expires its borrows.
- **Method receiver borrows**: calling a `&this` or `~this` method creates a borrow on the receiver variable.
- **Return reference safety**: returning a reference to a local (non-parameter) variable from a function with ref return type is an error.
- **Control flow propagation**: borrows are saved/restored/merged (union) across all control flow constructs (if/else, while, for-in, for, match, lambda, infinite loops) in parallel with move state.
- **Parameter borrow detection**: handles ANTLR grammar ambiguity where `string &s` parses as `typeRef=string&` (not separate refMod) by checking parameter types for `SharedRef`/`MutRef` in addition to `Ref()`.
- **Deferred**: explicit lifetime annotations, stored references in structs, full NLL last-use analysis, drop ordering, disjoint field borrows.

## Stage 7 — Meta Annotation Processing (Done)

Validates and processes built-in meta annotations, wiring them into the type system and ownership checker.

**Files:** New `sema/meta.go` (~170 LOC); updates to `sema/decl.go`, `sema/expr.go`, `sema/error.go`, `sema/info.go`, `types/named.go`, `types/field.go`, `types/enum.go`, `types/object.go`, `ownership/copy.go`; 21 new tests across sema + ownership

- **Meta target validation**: 18 built-in metas (`value`, `instance`, `variant`, `type`, `raw`, `abstract`, `native`, `copy`, `doc`, `deprecated`, `test`, `inline`, `packed`, `align`, `extern`, `serializable`, `public`, `unsafe`) mapped to allowed declaration targets. Unknown metas, wrong targets, and duplicates reported as errors.
- **`copy` meta**: Marks `Named`/`Enum` types as bitwise-copy, exempting them from move semantics. Transitive field validation ensures all fields of a `copy` type are themselves copy types. Ownership checker's `isCopyType` reads `Named.IsCopy()` / `Enum.IsCopy()`.
- **`doc` meta**: Extracts documentation strings from `\`doc("text")` annotations and stores on `Named`, `Field`, `Method`, `Func`, `Enum` types.
- **`deprecated` meta**: Stores deprecation messages. Usage warnings emitted when deprecated types, functions, fields, or methods are referenced in expressions.
- **`test` meta**: Tracks test functions in `Info.Tests` for future `promise test` runner.
- **Warning system**: `warnf` added to checker for non-fatal diagnostic messages (prefixed with "warning:").
- **Deferred metas**: `inline`, `packed`, `align`, `extern`, `serializable`, `public`, `unsafe` are validated for target correctness but processing deferred to later stages (codegen/module system).

## Stage 8a — LLVM Codegen: Primitives & Control Flow (Done)

Type-system-driven LLVM IR generation for primitive types, arithmetic, control flow, and functions.

**Files:** 6 new Go files in `compiler/internal/codegen/` (~900 LOC), `runtime/runtime.c` (7 LOC); updated `cmd/promise/main.go`, `grammar/PromiseParser.g4`; 32 codegen tests

- **Architecture**: `github.com/llir/llvm` (pure Go) builds IR in-memory, serializes to `.ll` text, compiled to native binary via `clang`.
- **Type-system-driven dispatch**: operators are methods on `*types.Named`, resolved via `LookupMethod(op)` → `IsNative()` → native emitter dispatch table. Codegen never hardcodes "if int and +, emit add."
- **TypeCategory classification** (`types.go`): types grouped into `CatSignedInt`, `CatUnsignedInt`, `CatFloat`, `CatBool`. Single comparison point against universe type singletons.
- **Native emitter table** (`native.go`): maps (TypeCategory, operator) → LLVM instruction emitter. Signed uses `sdiv`/`srem`/`slt`, unsigned uses `udiv`/`urem`/`ult`, float uses `fadd`/`fdiv`/`fcmp`, etc.
- **Short-circuit `&&`/`||`**: intercepted at AST level with phi-node branching (control flow, not single instruction).
- **Variable handling**: alloca + mem2reg strategy — every local gets `alloca`, reads use `load`, writes use `store`. LLVM's `mem2reg` pass promotes to SSA.
- **Two-pass compilation** (`compiler.go`): pass 1 declares all functions, pass 2 generates bodies.
- **Extern functions**: `funcDecl` with `(block | SEMI)` grammar — bodyless functions mapped to runtime print functions.
- **C runtime** (`runtime/runtime.c`): `promise_print_int`, `promise_print_f64`, `promise_print_bool`, `promise_panic`.
- **CLI**: `promise build file.pr [-o output]` and `promise run file.pr` compile through the full pipeline (parse → sema → ownership → codegen → clang).
- **Scope**: `int`/`i8`–`i64`/`uint`/`u8`–`u64`/`f32`/`f64`/`bool`, all arithmetic/comparison/logical ops, if/else, while, for-in (range), classic for, infinite loop, break/continue, function calls, compound assignment.

### Deferred sub-stages

- Ownership-aware memory management (drop) → Stage 8o
- Concurrency: `go`/`<-task` → Done (Phase 5a); `channel[T]` → Done (Phase 5b); M:N scheduler with select, preemption, panic recovery, GOMAXPROCS, sched stats → Done (Phase 5c)

## Stage 8b — Strings (Done)

String type codegen: representation, literals, concatenation, equality, extern ABI packing.

**Files:** Updates to `codegen/layout.go`, `codegen/compiler.go`, `codegen/expr.go`, `codegen/extern.go`, `codegen/types.go`, `codegen/headergen.go`; new `runtime/runtime_string.c`; 18 string-related tests

- **Internal representation**: Strings are `i8*` internally — opaque pointer to heap-allocated `promise_string_i` instance struct. `llvmNamedType(TypString)` returns `i8Ptr`.
- **String layout** (`layout.go`): Four-struct model with flexible array member. Instance struct `{ promise_string_m* _variant, i64 len, [0 x i8] data }` stores length + inline UTF-8 data. Value struct `{ i8* _vtable, promise_string_i* _instance }` is a lightweight handle. No `raw` field.
- **String literals** (`expr.go`): Compile to global constant + `call @promise_string_new(ptr, len)` → `i8*`. Escape sequences resolved at compile time (`\n`, `\t`, `\{`, etc.).
- **String concatenation**: `"a" + "b"` dispatches to `@promise_string_concat(i8*, i8*)` → `i8*` via native string operator path.
- **String equality**: `==` dispatches to `@promise_string_eq(i8*, i8*)` → `i1`. `!=` is `xor(eq, 1)`.
- **Extern ABI packing** (`extern.go`): `packString` wraps `i8*` → `%promise_string_v { null_vtable, bitcast(i8* → string_i*) }` via `insertvalue`. `unpackString` extracts field 1 + bitcasts back to `i8*`.
- **C runtime** (`runtime_string.c`): `promise_string_new` (malloc + memcpy), `promise_string_concat`, `promise_string_eq`, `promise_print_string` (fwrite). No null terminator — uses `len` field exclusively.
- **Header generation**: String layout always emitted (built-in type). Instance struct uses C99 flexible array member `char data[]`.
- **Scope**: Literals, variables, concatenation (`+`), equality (`==`, `!=`), extern passing/returning, empty strings.
- **Deferred**: Methods (`.len`, `.contains`, etc.), slicing, Unicode normalization. String interpolation completed in Stage 8h.

## Stage 8c — User Types (Done)

User-defined type codegen: four-struct layout, constructors, field access/assignment, method declaration/definition/calls, `this` keyword, extern ABI.

**Files:** Updates to `codegen/layout.go`, `codegen/compiler.go`, `codegen/expr.go`, `codegen/stmt.go`, `codegen/extern.go`; 20 user type tests (90 total codegen tests)

- **Internal representation**: User types are `i8*` internally — opaque pointer to heap-allocated `promise_T_i` instance struct. Same as strings. `llvmNamedType` returns `i8Ptr` via the default case.
- **Type layout** (`layout.go`): `computeUserTypeLayout` creates four LLVM struct types. Instance struct holds `{ promise_T_m* _variant, field1, field2, ... }` with field types from `llvmType()` (i64 for int, i8* for strings/user types, etc.). Value struct is `{ i8* _vtable, promise_T_i* _instance }` — no user fields. `InstanceFieldIndex` maps field names to GEP indices (1-indexed, `_variant` at 0). `InstancePtrType` caches the pointer-to-instance type.
- **C header field types**: Primitives use raw C types (`int64_t`, `uint8_t`); strings and user types use `void*` to avoid forward-declaration ordering issues.
- **Constructors** (`expr.go`): Detected when `info.Types[callee]` is `*types.Named`. Heap-allocate via `malloc(sizeof)` using GEP-from-null trick, bitcast to `%T_i*`, zero-initialize `_variant`, store named args by field index, zero-initialize unprovided fields. Returns `i8*`.
- **Field access** (`expr.go`): `d.age` → load `i8*`, bitcast to `%T_i*`, GEP to field index, load field value.
- **Field assignment** (`stmt.go`): `d.age = 5` → same as access but store. Compound assignment (`d.age += 1`) loads current value, applies operator via type system dispatch, stores result.
- **Method declaration** (`compiler.go`): Two-pass. `declareTypeMethods` creates LLVM function stubs with mangled names (`TypeName.methodName`). Receiver (if present) is first `i8*` parameter. `defineTypeMethods` generates bodies with `this` alloca.
- **Method calls** (`expr.go`): `d.getAge()` → resolve method from target type, prepend receiver as first arg, call `@TypeName.methodName`.
- **`this` keyword** (`expr.go`): Inside methods, `this` stored as `c.locals["this"]` alloca for `i8*`. `genThisExpr` loads from it.
- **Extern ABI** (`extern.go`): `packUserType`/`unpackUserType` follow same pattern as strings — `{ null_vtable, bitcast(i8* → T_i*) }` via insertvalue/extractvalue.
- **Compilation order**: `computeLayouts` → `computeUserTypeLayouts` → `declareIntrinsics` → `declareExterns` → `declareTypeMethods` → `declareFuncs` → `defineTypeMethods` → `defineFuncs`.
- **Scope**: Type layout, constructors (named args), field read/write, compound field assignment, methods with receiver (`this`/`&this`/`~this`), method calls, nested user type fields, extern pack/unpack.
- **Deferred**: Vtable/virtual dispatch, inheritance (parent fields/methods), static method calls (`Type.method()`), operator overloading on user types, non-instance field placements (`value`/`variant`/`type`), default field values. Generic user types handled in Stage 8f.

## Stage 8d — Enums and Pattern Matching (Done)

Enum type codegen: tagged unions, fieldless enums, variant constructors, pattern matching with switch, destructure bindings.

**Files:** Updates to `codegen/layout.go`, `codegen/compiler.go`, `codegen/expr.go`, `codegen/types.go`; 20 enum-related tests

- **Fieldless enums**: Internal type is `i32` (tag only). Variant values are `i32` constants. `Color.Red` → `i32 0`.
- **Data enums**: Internal type is `{ i32, [N x i8] }` — tag + byte array union sized to the largest variant. Per-variant data structs (e.g., `{ double }` for `Circle(f64)`) are bitcast-overlaid onto the data area.
- **Variant constructors**: `Shape.Circle(3.14)` → alloca enum struct, store tag at index 0, bitcast data area to variant struct pointer, store fields via GEP.
- **Pattern matching**: `match` on enum generates LLVM `switch` on tag. Each arm branches to a dedicated basic block. Wildcard/name patterns use the default target.
- **Destructure bindings**: `Some(v) =>` extracts the data area, bitcasts to variant struct, loads fields into local allocas. Supports `EnumDestructureMatchPattern`, `ShortDestructureMatchPattern`, and `NameMatchPattern` (binding the whole subject).
- **Enum layout** (`layout.go`): `computeEnumLayout` computes tag map, per-variant data struct types, max data size. Four-struct ABI model maintained (type/variant/instance/value structs) for future extern compatibility.
- **Scope**: Fieldless enums, data enums with positional fields, variant values, variant constructors, match with switch, destructure bindings, wildcard/name patterns.
- **Deferred**: Named enum fields in constructors, enum methods, extern ABI pack/unpack for enums.

## Stage 8e — Error Handling (Done)

Error handling codegen: failable function declarations, raise statements, error propagation (`?`), forced unwrap (`!`), error handler expressions, typed error handlers.

**Files:** Updates to `codegen/compiler.go`, `codegen/expr.go`, `codegen/stmt.go`, `codegen/types.go`, `sema/expr.go`, `sema/stmt.go`, `sema/info.go`, `sema/meta.go`, `sema/decl.go`, `types/named.go`, `grammar/PromiseParser.g4`, `ast/expr.go`, `ast/visit_expr.go`, `std/error.pr`; 17 error handling tests + 46 sema tests + 12 codegen tests + 40 e2e tests

- **Error base type**: `type error { string message; }` defined in `std/error.pr`. Universe type reuse merges std fields into `TypError`. All error types inherit from `error` via `is error`.
- **Result struct**: Non-void `T!` → `{ i1, T, i8* }` (tag, ok value, error pointer). Void `void!` → `{ i1, i8* }` (tag, error pointer). Tag: `i1 false` = Ok, `i1 true` = Error.
- **Error values are `i8*`**: Error instance pointers stored in result struct. `raise` on user types extracts the instance pointer from the value struct `{vtable, instance}`.
- **Failable declarations**: Functions/methods with `CanError()` return the result struct. `declareFuncs`/`declareTypeMethods` wrap return type with `computeResultType`.
- **Return wrapping**: `genReturnStmt` wraps the value in an Ok result (`{ false, val, null }`) when inside a failable function.
- **Raise statement**: `genRaiseStmt` wraps the error in an Error result (`{ true, zero, errVal }`) and returns. Validates raised value inherits from `error` at compile time.
- **Error propagation** (`?`): `genErrorPropagateExpr` checks the tag via `condBr`. Error path extracts the `i8*` error, re-wraps in caller's result type, early-returns. Ok path extracts the value.
- **Forced unwrap** (`!`): `genErrorUnwrapExpr` panics on error via `promise_panic(i8*)` + `unreachable`. Ok path extracts the value.
- **Untyped error handler** (`? e { body }`): `genErrorHandlerExpr` branches to handler block, reconstructs error value struct `{vtable_ptr, instance_ptr}` for the binding, generates body, merges with phi node.
- **Typed error handler** (`? e is IoError { body }`): RTTI check via `promise_type_is` on the error instance's `_variant` pointer. Match path: reconstruct typed value struct, generate body. No-match path: propagate error (in failable functions) or panic (in non-failable functions).
- **Failable validation**: `FailableExprs` map in sema `Info` records call expressions with failable signatures. Error operators (`?`, `!`, `? handler`) validate at compile time that their inner expression is failable.
- **Error type restrictions**: Error types cannot have `drop()` methods (error values are not tracked for cleanup; allowing drop would silently leak resources). Generic error types (`type DataError[T] is error { T data; }`) are supported.
- **Auto-terminator**: Failable functions without explicit terminator return an Ok-wrapped zero value.
- **`genBlockValue` helper**: Generates a block and returns the last expression's value without double-generating. Used by `genErrorHandlerExpr` and `genIfExpr`.
- **Scope**: Failable functions/methods, raise, `?` propagation, `!` unwrap, `? binding { body }` handlers, `? e is T { body }` typed handlers, void failables, generic error types.
- **Auto-propagation**: Naked failable calls in failable functions auto-propagate — codegen emits tag-check + early-return (same as explicit `?`). In non-failable functions, naked failable calls are a compile error: `"failable call must be handled with '?', '!', or an error handler"`. Tracked via `AutoPropagateExprs` map in sema `Info`.
- **Typed handler exhaustiveness**: Typed error handlers (`? e is T { }`) in non-failable functions require explicit handling of non-matching errors. Three options: `else` clause (`? e is T { } else { }`), `!` suffix (`? e is T { }!` — panics on nomatch), or making the function failable (propagates nomatch). In failable functions, unhandled nomatch auto-propagates. `else` supports optional binding: `? e is T { } else e { }`. `reconstructErrorValue` helper extracts vtable+instance from raw `i8*` error pointer.
- **Failable result capture**: `(val, err) := failableCall()` destructures a failable result into the success value and `error?` optional. Error path reconstructs error value struct from instance pointer; ok path yields absent optional. Tracked via `FailableDestructures` map in sema `Info`.
- **Deferred**: Failable extern functions (C ABI for errors). If-unwrap/while-unwrap completed in Stage 8h. Full type expressions in `is` patterns (generics, arrays, module-qualified — see Stage 8k deferred).

## Stage 8f — Generic Monomorphization (Done)

Generic function sema support and type-specialized code generation for all generic instantiations.

**Files:** New `codegen/mono.go` (~475 LOC); updates to `types/signature.go`, `types/subst.go`, `sema/decl.go`, `sema/check.go`, `sema/expr.go`, `sema/info.go`, `codegen/compiler.go`, `codegen/types.go`, `codegen/expr.go`, `codegen/stmt.go`; 6 new sema tests, 20 new codegen tests

**Part A — Sema: Generic functions/methods** (`types/`, `sema/`)
- **TypeParams on Signature** (`types/signature.go`): `typeParams []*TypeParam` field with `TypeParams()` accessor and `SetTypeParams()` setter. `substSignature` strips TypeParams when substituted.
- **Generic function definition** (`sema/decl.go`): `defineFunc` opens type-param scope, creates `TypeParam` objects, resolves constraints, stores on `Signature` via `SetTypeParams`.
- **Generic function body checking** (`sema/check.go`): `checkFuncDecl` opens type-param scope when `sig.TypeParams()` is non-empty, inserting TypeParam type names so `T` resolves during body checking.
- **Generic function calls** (`sema/expr.go`): `checkIndexExpr` detects `*types.Signature` with TypeParams → `instantiateGenericFunc`. Resolves type arg via `resolveTypeRef`, builds substitution map, substitutes signature (stripping TypeParams), records `FuncInstance`.
- **FuncInstance tracking** (`sema/info.go`): `FuncInstance{Func, TypeArgs, Sig}` struct records concrete generic function instantiations for codegen monomorphization.
- **Type reference resolution** (`sema/expr.go`): `resolveTypeRef` resolves expressions as type references (for `int` in `func[int]`), recording type and object on the AST node for codegen consumption.

**Part B — Codegen: Monomorphization** (`codegen/`)
- **Monomorphization, not type erasure**: Each concrete `Instance{Box, [int]}` gets a distinct LLVM layout with correctly-typed fields (`i64` for int, not `i8*`).
- **Naming convention**: `Box__int`, `Pair__int__string`, `Option__int` for types. `identity__int` for generic functions. Double-underscore separator — no collision with Promise identifiers.
- **Core infrastructure** (`mono.go`): `monoContext` struct, `monoName`/`typeArgSuffix`/`monoFuncName` mangling, `collectMonoInstances`/`collectMonoFuncInstances` deduplication. Layout computation: `computeMonoUserTypeLayout` (four-struct ABI with substituted field types), `computeMonoEnumLayout` (tagged union with substituted variant fields). Method/function codegen: `declareMonoMethods`/`defineMonoMethods`/`declareMonoFuncs`/`defineMonoFuncs` with `typeSubst`+`monoCtx` scoping and `defer`-based state cleanup.
- **Compiler integration** (`compiler.go`): New fields (`monoLayouts`, `monoEnumLayouts`, `typeSubst`, `monoCtx`). Dispatch helpers: `lookupTypeLayout`/`lookupEnumLayout` (handle Instance, monoCtx, regular types), `resolveTypeName` (mangled names for method dispatch). Generic origins skipped in existing passes; 14-step compilation pipeline.
- **Type resolution** (`types.go`): `resolveType` applies `typeSubst` first, then handles Instance (enum → mono layout, named → `i8Ptr`), then regular enums with `monoCtx` awareness. `llvmTypeSize` handles `StructType` and `ArrayType` for correct enum data area sizing.
- **Expression codegen** (`expr.go`): Instance constructor detection, `genConstructorCallMono` with `lookupTypeLayout`, `genFieldAccess` with layout-driven field types, `genMethodCall` with `resolveTypeName`, enum operations via `lookupEnumLayout`, `genGenericFuncCall` for `identity[int](42)` dispatch with `typeSubst` application.
- **Statement codegen** (`stmt.go`): `genMemberAssign` uses `lookupTypeLayout` and layout field types for both regular and monomorphic types.
- **Layout-driven field types**: All field load/store/zero-init operations use `layout.Instance.Fields[idx].LLVMType` instead of `llvmType(field.Type())`, which correctly handles TypeParam substitution.
- **Scope**: Generic user type instantiation (layout, constructor, field access/assignment, methods), generic enum instantiation (tagged union, variant values/constructors, pattern matching, destructure bindings), generic functions (single type parameter, void/non-void/failable), multiple instantiations of same generic.
- **Deferred**: Type argument inference (explicit type args only), multi-arg generics in expression context (grammar limitation), extern ABI for generic types, C header generation for monomorphic types, container types (Array, Slice, Map, Tuple — Stage 8g).

## Stage 8g — Container Codegen (Done)

Codegen for container types (tuples, optionals, slices, maps) and capturing lambdas.

**Files:** Updates to `codegen/compiler.go`, `codegen/types.go`, `codegen/expr.go`, `codegen/stmt.go`; new `runtime/runtime_map.c` (~205 LOC); 29 new tests (119 total codegen tests)

- **Tuples**: Value type, LLVM struct `{ T0, T1, ... }`. Literals via `insertvalue`, destructuring (`(a, b) := expr`) via `extractvalue`. Mixed-type tuples supported.
- **Optionals**: Value type, `{ i1, T }` struct. `none` = zeroinitializer, some = `{ true, val }`. `targetType` field on Compiler resolves contextual type for `NoneLit` (sema records `TypNone` but codegen needs `Optional(T)`). `lookupLocalType` detects `OptionalTypeRef` annotations and resolves declared types from sema scopes.
- **Elvis operator** (`?:`): `genElvis` extracts flag, condBr → some block (extract value) / none block (evaluate default), phi merge.
- **Optional wrapping**: Assigning `T` to `T?` variable auto-wraps via `wrapOptional` (insertvalue `{ true, val }`).
- **Slices / Array literals**: Heap-allocated `i8*` → `{ i64 len, i64 cap, [data...] }`. 16-byte header + inline elements. `genArrayLit` mallocs, stores header via GEP, stores elements via typed GEP past header. Both `*types.Slice` and `*types.Array` map to `i8Ptr`.
- **Slice indexing**: Bounds-checked with `icmp ult` (unsigned, catches negative indices). Out-of-bounds calls `promise_panic` + `unreachable`. Read via `genSliceIndex`, write via `genSliceIndexAssign` (supports compound assignment like `arr[i] += 1`).
- **Maps**: Type-erased C runtime hash table (`runtime/runtime_map.c`). Open-addressing with FNV-1a hash, 75% load rehash. Entry layout: `[used:1][key_bytes][val_bytes]` inline. Functions: `promise_map_new`, `promise_map_set`, `promise_map_get`, `promise_map_len`, `promise_map_iter_next`.
- **String map keys**: Content-based hashing via `__promise_hash_string` / `__promise_eq_string` (codegen-emitted LLVM IR, dereference `i8*` to read string header). Byte-level hash/compare for primitive keys (NULL function pointers → default). `runtime_hash.c` fully eliminated.
- **Map indexing**: `m["key"]` returns `Optional(V)` — calls `promise_map_get`, checks NULL, wraps in `{ i1, V }` via phi merge. Assignment via `promise_map_set`.
- **For-in iteration**: `genForInStmt` dispatches on iterable type. Slices: counter loop with bounds check per element. Maps: `promise_map_iter_next` loop building `(K, V)` tuple per entry. Ranges: existing `genForInRange` extracted.
- **Lambdas (capturing)**: Anonymous LLVM functions (`.lambda.N`) with `i8* %env` as first parameter (uniform ABI). Fat pointer representation `{ i8*, i8* }` (fn ptr + env ptr) for all function values. Non-capturing lambdas use null env. Compiler state saved/restored (fn, block, locals, canError, scopeBindings, dropFlags). Handles both expression body (`|x| -> x + 1`) and block body (`|x| -> int { return x * 2; }`).
- **Lambda captures**: Sema capture analysis (`checkLambdaCapture`) detects outer-scope variable references via scope chain traversal. `Copy` types auto-captured by copy; non-`Copy` types require explicit `move` keyword. Captures recorded in `info.LambdaCaptures` (deterministic order via sorted names). Nested lambda capture propagation: inner captures from grandparent scopes automatically propagate to intermediate lambdas.
- **Lambda env struct**: Heap-allocated struct holding captured values (`malloc`). Captures loaded from enclosing scope allocas, stored into env fields. Inside lambda body, env is bitcast to typed pointer, fields extracted into local allocas. Move-captured droppable types registered for drop inside lambda body. Env struct freed at scope exit via `bindingFreeEnv` binding (drop-flag-guarded, null-checked `free()`).
- **Lambda calls**: `genCallExpr` detects local variables with `*types.Signature` type before regular function lookup. Loads fat pointer `{ i8*, i8* }`, calls `genIndirectCall` which extracts fn/env, bitcasts to typed function pointer with env-first ABI, calls with env as first arg.
- **Named function references**: When a named function is used as a first-class value (e.g., `f := add`), a thunk with env-first ABI is generated (`.thunk.add`) that forwards to the original function. Fat pointer uses `{ @.thunk.add, null }`.
- **Lambda ownership**: Move captures mark the variable as `Moved` in the enclosing scope. Captured variables are `Owned` inside the lambda body. Copy captures leave the original variable usable.
- **Intrinsics** (`compiler.go`): 7 new map runtime functions declared in `declareIntrinsics`. `lambdaCounter` and `targetType` fields added to Compiler.
- **Scope**: Tuple literals/destructure/return, optional none/some/wrapping/elvis, array literals, slice/array indexing (read/write/compound), for-in over slices/arrays/maps, map literals/indexing/assignment, capturing lambdas (expression/block body, indirect calls, copy/move captures, nested capture propagation, env allocation/cleanup, named function reference thunks).
- **Deferred**: Slice growth (`.push()`), container methods (`.contains`), fixed-size arrays as stack-allocated `[N x T]`, `llvmTypeSize` struct alignment (current implementation sums without padding — correct for primitive elements, under-allocates for struct-typed slice elements). String interpolation, if-unwrap/while-unwrap, optional chaining, and unsafe blocks completed in Stage 8h. Container `.len` completed in Stage 8i.

## Stage 8h — Optional Patterns, String Interpolation & Expression Completeness (Done)

Codegen for if-unwrap, while-unwrap, optional chaining, string interpolation, and unsafe blocks.

**Files:** Updates to `codegen/expr.go`, `codegen/stmt.go`, `codegen/compiler.go`, `ast/expr.go`, `ast/visit_expr.go`, `sema/expr.go`, `runtime/runtime_string.c`; 12 new tests (131 total codegen tests)

- **If-unwrap**: `if val := optExpr { }` — `genIfUnwrapStmt` extracts flag from `{ i1, T }` optional, condBr to then-block where inner value is extracted and bound to a scoped local. Optional else-block. Binding variable saved/restored to prevent scope leak.
- **While-unwrap**: `while val := optExpr { }` — `genWhileUnwrapStmt` with header/body/exit blocks. Optional re-evaluated each iteration in header. break/continue targets set correctly. Same scope-leak fix as if-unwrap.
- **Optional chaining**: `x?.field` — `genOptionalChainExpr` checks optional flag, accesses field on inner value in some-block, wraps result in `Optional(FieldType)`. None-block produces zeroinitializer. Phi merge at end. `genFieldOnValue` helper extracted for field access on raw values.
- **String interpolation** (cross-cutting):
  - **AST**: `StringInterp` gains `Expr` field (parsed expression from `{expr}` syntax).
  - **AST builder**: `parseInterpolationExpr` re-lexes/re-parses expression text via fresh ANTLR lexer/parser. `offsetExprPositions` recursively adjusts AST node positions to match original source locations.
  - **Sema**: StringLit case extended to type-check interpolation expressions.
  - **Runtime**: ~~`promise_int_to_string`, `promise_f64_to_string`, `promise_bool_to_string` conversion functions in `runtime_string.c` using `snprintf`~~ — now codegen-emitted LLVM IR (`defineIntToStringFunc`, `defineUintToStringFunc`, `defineF64ToStringFunc`, `defineBoolToStringFunc`, `defineCharToStringFunc` in compiler.go).
  - **Codegen**: `genStringLit` split into `genStaticString` (compile-time, no interpolation) and `genInterpolatedString` (runtime). `convertToString` handles all primitive types with sext/zext/fpext as needed. Parts concatenated via `promise_string_concat`. Both `promise_string_new` and `promise_string_concat` are codegen-emitted LLVM IR using `@llvm.memcpy` intrinsic.
  - **Intrinsics**: 14 functions defined as codegen LLVM IR in `declareIntrinsics`: `promise_string_new`, `promise_string_concat`, 5 conversion functions (`bool`, `int`, `uint`, `f64`, `char` to string), `promise_vector_with_capacity`, `promise_vector_push`, `promise_vector_pop`, `promise_string_trim`, `promise_string_split`, `promise_string_next_char`, `promise_type_is`.
- **Unsafe blocks**: `genUnsafeExpr` trivially generates block contents. Ownership analysis handles the "unsafe" semantics, not codegen.
- **Scope**: If-unwrap (with/without else), while-unwrap (with break/continue), optional chaining on user type fields, string interpolation with identifiers/literals/expressions/multiple parts, unsafe blocks.
- **Deferred**: `is`/`as` expressions (need RTTI), generators (`yield`), container methods (`.push`, `.pop`, `.contains`), user type `toString()` for interpolation. Container `.len` completed in Stage 8i. `go`/`<-task` concurrency completed in Phase 5a. `channel[T]` completed in Phase 5b.

## Stage 8i — Char Literals, Container `.len`, String Iteration & Map Compound Assignment (Done)

Codegen for char literals, `.len` property on all containers (string, slice, array, map), for-in over strings, and map compound assignment.

**Files:** Updates to `codegen/expr.go`, `codegen/stmt.go`, `codegen/compiler.go`, `codegen/types.go`, `codegen/native.go`, `sema/expr.go`, `sema/stmt.go`, `runtime/runtime_string.c`, `types/container.go`; 25 new tests (19 codegen → 227 total, 6 sema → 214 total)

- **Char literals**: `genCharLit` parses raw text including escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\b`, `\\`, `\'`, `\0`), returns i32 constant. `CatChar` classification added to `types.go` with signed i32 comparisons in `native.go`.
- **Container `.len` property**: Uniform property access across all container types — `arr.len`, `m.len`, `s.len`. Slice/array reads i64 from heap header (GEP index 0). Map calls `promise_map_len`. String reads i64 from instance struct (GEP index 1). Sema extended with `Slice`/`Array`/`Map` cases in `checkMemberExpr` and `TypString` special case in Named handler.
- **For-in over strings**: `genForInString` iterates UTF-8 codepoints via `promise_string_next_char` runtime function. Byte position tracked in i64 alloca, -1 sentinel for end. Index variable (`for i, ch in s`) supported with separate counter.
- **Map compound assignment**: `genMapCompoundAssign` gets current value via `promise_map_get`, NULL-checks with panic on missing key, applies operator, stores back via `promise_map_set`. Sema fix unwraps Optional for operator lookup on map value type.
- **Char interpolation**: `convertToString` extended with `TypChar` case calling `promise_char_to_string` (UTF-8 encode).
- **Deferred**: Evaluation order bug in compound index assignment (RHS evaluated before LHS target/key — see comment in `genMapCompoundAssign`).

## Stage 8k — Inheritance Codegen, RTTI & is/as Expressions (Done)

Codegen for inherited field layouts, static method dispatch through inheritance chains, runtime type information (RTTI), and `is`/`as` expressions.

**Files:** New file `codegen/rtti.go`; updates to `types/named.go`, `codegen/layout.go`, `codegen/mono.go`, `codegen/compiler.go`, `codegen/expr.go`, `sema/expr.go`, `sema/decl.go`, `runtime/runtime.c`; 27 new tests (24 codegen → 251 total, 5 sema → 219 total)

- **Sema validation**: Prevent abstract type instantiation (`IsAbstract()` check in `checkConstructorCall` and `checkInstanceConstructorCall`, including generic instances). Reject multiple concrete parents (more than one parent with fields, checked transitively via `AllFields()`). Allow multiple fieldless/abstract parents. Enum variant names accepted in `is` patterns when subject is an enum type (including generic enum instances).
- **Inherited field layout**: `AllFields()` on Named gathers parent fields first (depth-first, single concrete parent chain), then own fields. Child fields shadow parent fields with the same name. `computeUserTypeLayout` and `computeMonoUserTypeLayout` use `AllFields()` so child instance structs include inherited fields at prefix-compatible indices. Topological ordering ensures parent layouts are computed before children.
- **Static method dispatch**: `resolveMethodOwner` walks the parent chain to find which type actually defines a method. `genMethodCall` uses the defining type's name for mangling (e.g., `Animal.greet` when called on Dog). Monomorphized method names preserved for generic types.
- **RTTI infrastructure**: Each non-generic Named type gets a unique i32 type ID. Type info globals (`@promise_typeinfo_TypeName`) store `{ i32 type_id, i32 num_parents, [N x i32] parent_ids }` with transitive parent IDs. Constructors store the type info pointer in the `_variant` slot (index 0) instead of null. Runtime function `promise_type_is(variant_ptr, expected_id)` checks type ID and parent IDs.
- **is expressions**: `x is present` → `extractvalue` i1 flag from optional. `x is absent` → extract + xor negate. `c is Variant` → extract enum tag, `icmp eq`. `a is Dog` → load `_variant` pointer, call `promise_type_is`, convert i32→i1.
- **as expressions**: `a as Dog` (safe) → RTTI check, branch to `cast.some` (wrap in Optional) or `cast.none` (zeroinitializer), phi merge. `a as! Dog` (force) → RTTI check, branch to `cast.ok` or `cast.panic` (calls `promise_panic`).
- **Deferred**: Virtual dispatch (vtable — completed in Stage 8L), destructure is-patterns (`x is Dog(name)`), generic type RTTI, full type expressions in `is` patterns and typed error handlers. Both `if x is TYPE` and `? e is TYPE` currently only accept bare `IDENT`. Need to support `typeRef` (generics like `DataError[int]`, arrays like `int[]`, optionals like `Foo?`, module-qualified like `std.Error`). The `typeRef` grammar rule already supports these forms — requires updating `pattern` rule, `ErrorHandlerExpr` grammar, AST, sema type resolution, and codegen RTTI for monomorphized type IDs.

## Stage 8j — Unify Compound Types with Named Types + Collection Methods (Done)

Promoted `slice[T]` and `map[K,V]` from structural placeholder types (`*types.Slice`, `*types.Map`) to real Named types in the universe scope, represented as `Instance{TypSlice, [T]}` and `Instance{TypMap, [K, V]}`. Method/field lookup flows through the existing `resolveInstanceMember` → `LookupMethod` → type substitution path — the same path used for user-defined generic types.

**Type System Changes:**
- Added `TypSlice = defGeneric("slice", "T")` to universe scope
- Deleted `Slice` and `Map` structs from `types/container.go`
- `NewSlice(elem)` and `NewMap(key, val)` now return `*Instance`
- Added helper functions `IsSlice`, `AsSlice`, `IsMap`, `AsMap` for clean migration
- `Instance.String()` overridden so `slice[int]` displays as `int[]`
- Deleted `case *Slice:` and `case *Map:` from `equal.go` and `subst.go`

**Native Methods Registered in `builtins.go`:**
- **slice[T]**: `len` field, `push(T)`, `pop() → T?`, `contains(T) → bool`, `remove(int)`
- **map[K,V]**: `len` field, `contains(K) → bool`, `remove(K) → bool`, `keys() → K[]`, `values() → V[]`
- **string**: `len` field, `contains(string) → bool`, `starts_with(string) → bool`, `ends_with(string) → bool`, `index_of(string) → int?`, `trim() → string`, `split(string) → string[]`

**Runtime:**
- New `runtime_slice.c`: push (with realloc growth), pop, contains, remove
- Updated `runtime_map.c`: tombstone support (0=empty, 1=used, 2=tombstone), remove, contains, keys, values
- Updated `runtime_string.c`: ~~contains, starts_with, ends_with, index_of~~ (migrated to pure Promise), trim, split

**Sema/Codegen Migration:**
- ~35 `case *types.Slice:` / `case *types.Map:` switch cases migrated to `AsSlice`/`AsMap` helpers
- `.len` removed as special case — now a real field lookup
- Array delegates field/method lookup to TypSlice (rejects mutating methods like `push`/`remove`)

## Stage 8L — Virtual Dispatch (Done)

Vtable generation and indirect method calls for inheritance and interface types.

- **Vtable layout**: Each Named type with virtual methods gets a vtable global containing function pointers ordered by `AllVirtualMethods()`. Child types extend parent vtable layout — parent slots at prefix positions, child slots appended. Getter and setter with the same name occupy distinct vtable slots via `methodSlotKey()` — setters keyed as `name$set`, getters/methods keyed by bare name.
- **View-specific vtables**: When a value crosses an interface/parent boundary (assignment, function argument, return), the compiler generates a view vtable with slots ordered by the target type's method layout. The value struct's vtable pointer is swapped at the coercion point.
- **Indirect calls**: Method calls on interface-typed or parent-typed variables use vtable-indexed indirect calls (`call` through GEP'd function pointer) instead of direct `call @TypeName.methodName`. Includes virtual dispatch for getters via `genVirtualGetterCall` and setters via `genVirtualSetterCall`.
- **Setter mangling**: Setter IR functions use `TypeName.methodName$set` to avoid collision with same-name getters in the `c.funcs` map. `mangleMethodName()` helper used consistently across compiler passes (forward decl, body def, monomorphization, vtable emission, call sites).
- **Abstract satisfaction**: `IsAbstract()` and `allAbstractMethods()` use `methodSlotKey` for matching — a concrete setter does not satisfy an abstract getter (and vice versa). Both must be independently implemented.
- **Constructor vtable assignment**: Constructors store the type's vtable pointer into the value struct's slot 0 (currently stores RTTI in `_variant`).
- **Kind-aware method lookup**: All 4 call sites that resolve AST `MethodDecl` to `types.Method` (sema check, sema returns, ownership, codegen) dispatch through getter/setter/method-aware lookup instead of name-only `LookupAnyMethod`.
- **Tests**: 301 codegen tests (including virtual getter dispatch, getter override dispatch, direct getter preservation, same-name getter+setter vtable, view vtable getter+setter, generic getter+setter, compound assignment getter+setter).
- **Deferred**: Devirtualization optimization (when concrete type is known at compile time, use direct call).

## Stage 8m — `use` Bindings: Scoped Resource Lifetime (Done)

Scoped resource management via `use` variable declaration modifier. When the enclosing scope exits, the compiler automatically calls `close()` on the bound variable.

**Grammar:** `useVarDecl: USE IDENT WALRUS expression SEMI;` added as first `statement` alternative.

**AST:** `UseVarDecl` node with `Name string`, `Value Expr` fields. Visitor, printer, and statement dispatch added.

**Sema:** `checkUseVarDecl` type-checks the value expression, extracts `Named` type (handles `Named` and `Instance`), verifies `close()` method exists via `LookupMethod("close")` (structural satisfaction — no `is Closer` required), and inserts the variable into scope. 5 sema tests.

**Codegen:** `useBinding` struct tracks alloca, close function (direct dispatch), named type (virtual dispatch), and value type. `genUseVarDecl` allocates the variable and resolves direct/virtual dispatch for `close()`. `emitUseCloseCalls(fromIdx)` emits close calls in LIFO order at all scope exit points:
- **Fall-through:** `genBlock` emits close calls after generating all statements
- **Return/Raise:** `genReturnStmt` and `genRaiseStmt` emit `emitUseCloseCalls(0)` before exit
- **Break/Continue:** `genBreakStmt` and `genContinueStmt` emit `emitUseCloseCalls(loopUseDepth)` for loop-scoped bindings
- All 8 loop functions save/restore `loopUseDepth`
- Phase 1: close errors are silently suppressed (failable close error propagation deferred to follow-up)
4 codegen tests.

**Ownership:** `pinned map[string]bool` field on `Checker`. `use`-bound variables are marked as pinned — `tryMove` rejects moves of pinned variables. 1 ownership test.

## Stage 8n — Constructors: `new`, `final`, Factory, `Self`, `super` (Done)

Explicit constructors, immutable-after-construction fields, factory constructors, `Self` type alias, and constructor inheritance with `super()` calls.

**Files:** `sema/check.go`, `sema/decl.go`, `sema/expr.go`, `sema/stmt.go`, `sema/meta.go`, `sema/resolve.go`, `sema/info.go`, `types/field.go`, `types/named.go`, `codegen/compiler.go`, `codegen/expr.go`

- **Required field enforcement**: Sema rejects constructor calls that omit required fields. A field is required if it is not `T?` and has no `= default`. All required fields must be provided as named arguments.
- **Default expression evaluation**: Fields with `= expr` defaults have their default expression evaluated at the call site when omitted. Defaults recorded in `Info.FieldDefaults` during sema, evaluated in `genConstructorCallMono` during codegen.
- **`` `final `` fields**: `isFinal` flag on `types.Field`. Can be assigned in `new()` body or on locally-created instances in `` `factory `` methods. No setter generated. Custom setter on `` `final `` field is a compile error.
- **`Self` type alias**: Resolves to `c.curType` in both type-ref context (`resolveNamedType`) and expression context (`checkIdentExpr`). Usable in return types, constructor calls (`Self(...)`), and parameter types within type bodies.
- **Explicit `new` constructor**: `new(~this, params)` replaces the implicit constructor. Implicit `~this` receiver, implicit `Self` return. Sema validates: mutable receiver, no explicit return type, not abstract. `HasNew` flag on `types.Named`. Codegen zero-inits all fields, then calls `Type.new(instancePtr, args...)`.
- **Failable `new`**: `new(~this, params) void!` — codegen wraps result in `{ i1, T, i8* }` result struct with branch/merge/phi for error vs ok paths at the constructor call site.
- **Factory constructors**: `` `factory `` annotation implies `` `variant `` placement. No `this` receiver (set to nil in `resolveMethodSignature`). Must have return type (typically `Self`). Called as `Type.factoryName()`. `` `final `` field writes restricted to locally-created instances via `factoryLocals` tracking.
- **`super()` calls**: Parsed as `CallExpr(IdentExpr("super"), args)` — no grammar changes. Intercepted before normal callee resolution in both sema and codegen. When parent has `new()`, calls `ParentType.new(this, args...)`. When parent has implicit constructor, sets parent fields directly via child's layout. Failable parent `new()` propagates errors.
- **Constructor inheritance validation**: Runs as a post-define pass (`validateConstructors`) after all types are defined, ensuring correct validation regardless of declaration order. Child must define `new()` when parent has `new()`. Child `new()` must be failable when parent `new()` is failable.
- **`lookupOwnMethod` helper**: Searches only a type's directly declared methods, not inherited — prevents `LookupMethod("new")` from finding a parent's `new()` and incorrectly setting `HasNew`.
- **Scope**: Required fields, default expressions, `` `final `` fields, `Self` type alias, explicit `new()`, failable `new()`, factory constructors, `super()` with explicit/implicit parent, constructor inheritance validation.
- **Deferred**: Definite-assignment analysis for `` `final `` fields in `new()` body, `super()` position tracking (no `this` before `super`, exactly-once enforcement, no `super` in loops).

## Stage 8o — `drop()` Methods: Ownership-Driven Cleanup (Done)

Compiler-inserted `drop()` calls when a value's owner goes out of scope and the value has not been moved.

**Sema:**
- Validate `drop()` signature: must be `drop(~this)` with no return type and no `!`
- Reject `drop()` on `` `copy `` types (compile error)
- Track which Named types have `drop()` methods in `Info`

**Codegen:**
- At scope exit, for each local variable (reverse declaration order): if type has `drop()` and value was not moved and not declared with `use`, emit `drop()` call
- **Drop flags**: for variables with ownership that depends on control flow (moved in one branch, not another), emit a boolean `alloca` (drop flag) initialized to `true`. Set to `false` when moved. At scope exit, condBr on flag before calling `drop()`.
- **Field dropping**: after parent `drop()` returns, recursively emit `drop()` calls for each field whose type has `drop()`, in reverse declaration order
- **`use` suppression**: variables declared with `use` are excluded from `drop()` insertion — `close()` already handles their cleanup

**Ownership:**
- Integrate with existing move tracking: when a variable is moved, record that it should not be dropped
- Extend control flow merge to track drop eligibility across branches

**Runtime:** No runtime changes — `drop()` is a regular method call.

## Stage 9 — Module System (Planned)

Module resolution and dependency management.

- URL-based module identity with version in path
- `use alias "url"` import processing
- Dependency graph construction from source
- Flat directory layout (no required `src/`)
- Cycle detection

## Stage 10 — CLI

Command-line interface. Core commands implemented; formatter planned.

- `promise build [-o output] <file.pr>` — compile to binary
- `promise run <file.pr>` — compile and execute
- `promise check <file.pr>` — type-check only
- `promise test <file.pr>` — discover and run `test` meta-annotated functions
- `promise test <dir>` — scan directory for `.pr` files and run tests from each
- `promise test <dir>/...` — recursive directory scan (Go-style `...` wildcard)
- `promise test -timeout <duration>` — per-test timeout (default: 60s, accepts Go durations or plain seconds)
- `promise ast <file.pr>` — print the AST
- `promise exec <code>` — execute inline code (auto-wraps in `main()` if needed)
- `promise install` — install compiler + std + runtime to `~/.promise/`
- Bare pipe detection: `echo '<code>' | promise` auto-enters exec mode
- Inline error formatting: source line + `^` caret marker, no temp filenames
- Embedded `std/` and `runtime/` in the binary via `go:embed` for self-contained install
- **Test suite**: 613 tests across 118 files — `tests/e2e/` (language features), `tests/std/` (standard library), `tests/concurrency/` (scheduler, channels, select, panic recovery, stress tests)
- `promise fmt` — code formatter (planned)

### Stress test mode (`-stress`)

Flaky test detection via repeated execution with adaptive scheduling.

**Files:** `cmd/promise/stress.go` (~560 LOC), `cmd/promise/main.go` (flag parsing)

- `promise test -stress <target>` — run until Ctrl+C
- `promise test -stress N <target>` — run N iterations
- `promise test -stress <duration> <target>` — run for a time limit (e.g. `30s`, `2m`)
- **Compile-once, run-many**: all `.pr` files are compiled to temp binaries once, then re-executed repeatedly. Compilation errors are deterministic and exit immediately.
- **Per-test stats**: pass/fail count, timing mean/stddev/CoV (coefficient of variation), min/max. Timing parsed from test binary output (`PASS (0.003s) test_name`) for unit tests, wall-clock for e2e tests.
- **Flaky detection**: tests with any failure flagged as flaky. Tests with CoV > 0.5 and mean > 1ms flagged as high-variance (timing instability often precedes flakiness).
- **Adaptive file-level scheduling**: stable files gradually suppressed — run every 2nd iteration after 20 runs, every 4th after 50, every 8th after 100. Files with failures or high variance always run every iteration.
- **Live TTY display**: clears and redraws summary each iteration showing flaky/high-variance/stable counts. Non-TTY (piped) mode prints progress every 2 seconds.
- **SIGINT handling**: Ctrl+C stops the loop and prints the final report.
- **Exit code**: 0 if all tests 100% pass rate, 1 if any flaky tests found.

## Stage 11 — Package Manager (Planned)

Dependency fetching and resolution.

- Fetch from git/HTTP URLs
- Lockfile generation and deterministic builds
- Diamond dependency resolution
- Cache management

## What's Next

The compiler pipeline (Stages 1-8o) is complete for the current feature set. The runtime is fully codegen-emitted LLVM IR — no C files remain. Phase 5a added 1:1 threading (`go`/`<-` with OS threads). Phase 5b added typed channels (`channel[T]`). Phase 5c replaced 1:1 threading with an M:N scheduler using LLVM coroutine intrinsics — goroutines are cheap coroutine handles multiplexed on OS threads via per-CPU processors and work stealing. Scheduler enhancements completed: P-local run queues with work stealing, cooperative preemption (yield checks at function entry and loop back-edges), `select` statement (multi-channel blocking with default), goroutine-scoped panic recovery (setjmp/longjmp per-G, panics don't kill the process), `set_max_procs`/`get_max_procs` runtime API, and scheduler profiling counters (gs_created, gs_completed, context_switches, steals). CLI stress testing (`promise test -stress`) detects flaky tests via repeated execution with adaptive scheduling, timing variance analysis, and live reporting. IO reactor and WASM scheduling remain (Phases 5d-6). The next work falls into three areas:

### Near-term: Language Features

| Work | Design Doc | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| ~~Operator method dispatch (`[]`, `[]=`, `[:]`, `[:]=`)~~ | [subscript-slice-operators.md](subscript-slice-operators.md) | ~~High~~ Done |
| ~~C binding architecture (generated headers)~~ | [c-binding-architecture.md](c-binding-architecture.md) | ~~Medium~~ Done |

### Near-term: Compiler Infrastructure

| Work | Priority |
|------|----------|
| Module system (URL-based imports, dependency graph) — Stage 9 | High |
| CLI: `promise fmt` code formatter — Stage 10 | Medium |
| Package manager (fetch, resolve, lock) — Stage 11 | Medium |

### Long-term: Runtime & Platform

| Work | Design Doc | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Channels (`channel[T]`, buffered send/receive) — Phase 5b | [runtime-proposal.md](runtime-proposal.md) | Done |
| M:N scheduler (LLVM coroutines, GMP model, work stealing, select, preemption, panic recovery, GOMAXPROCS, sched stats) — Phase 5c | [runtime-proposal.md](runtime-proposal.md) | Done |
| WASM target (`--target wasm32-wasi`, bump allocator, coop scheduler) — Phases 4b/5d/7a | [runtime-proposal.md](runtime-proposal.md) | Done |
| IO reactor (kqueue/epoll/IOCP) — Phase 6 | [runtime-proposal.md](runtime-proposal.md) | Low |
| Replace clang with `llc` + `lld` — Phase 7 | [runtime-proposal.md](runtime-proposal.md) | Low |

### WASM remaining work

Tests: 618 pass, 0 fail, 16 skip on `wasm32-wasi` (634 native)

| Item | Skipped tests | Effort | Notes |
|------|--------------|--------|-------|
| f64→string (custom dtoa) | 12 (5 e2e files + 7 unit) | Medium | `snprintf` stub returns "?". Need custom double-to-string in LLVM IR or Promise. Grisu2/Ryu algorithm. |
| Panic recovery (`setjmp`/`longjmp`) | 2 (panic_recovery_basic, panic_recovery_channel) | Medium | WASM has no `setjmp`/`longjmp`. Options: Emscripten-style JS exception handling, or WASM exception handling proposal (`try`/`catch`/`throw` instructions). |
| Free-list allocator | 1 (goroutine_1000 OOM) | Medium | Current bump allocator never frees. Add free-list on top of bump for long-running programs. |
| GOMAXPROCS >1 | 1 (gomaxprocs_query) | Low | Single-threaded WASM can't have multiple Ps. Could clamp silently instead of panicking. |
| `clock_time_get` (WASI timing) | 0 | Low | `nanotime()` returns 0. Import `clock_time_get` from WASI for real timing. |
| File IO (`fd_read`, `fd_prestat_*`) | 0 | Low | No tests depend on it yet. Needed for WASI filesystem access. |
| WASM threading (shared memory + atomics) | 0 | Future | `wasm32-unknown-unknown` or threads proposal for true multi-P. |
| Browser/JS FFI | 0 | Future | `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, JS host bindings. |

## Naming Convention Migration

Bring the compiler and stdlib in line with the naming conventions defined in [standard-runtime.md](standard-runtime.md#naming-conventions). All non-scalar types use PascalCase canonical names; lowercase forms are syntactic sugar resolved by the compiler.

### Step 1 — Rename `iter` → `Iterator`, `stream` → `Stream` in universe

**Files:** `compiler/internal/types/universe.go`

- Change `defGeneric("iter", "T")` → `defGeneric("Iterator", "T")`
- Change `defGeneric("stream", "T")` → `defGeneric("Stream", "T")`
- Update all Go references to `TypIter` / `TypStream` names (the Go variable names can stay, but `Named.Name` must be PascalCase)

### Step 2 — Rename `map` → `Map`, `channel` → `Channel`, `task` → `Task`, `range` → `Range` in universe

**Files:** `compiler/internal/types/universe.go`

- Change `defGeneric("map", "K", "V")` → `defGeneric("Map", "K", "V")`
- Change `defGeneric("channel", "T")` → `defGeneric("Channel", "T")`
- Change `defGeneric("task", "T")` → `defGeneric("Task", "T")`
- Change `defNamed("range")` → `defNamed("Range")`
- These types already have lowercase sugar forms in the parser — this step makes PascalCase the canonical name

### Step 3 — Add sugar resolution in sema

**Files:** `compiler/internal/sema/check.go` or `compiler/internal/sema/resolve.go`

- When the parser sees `map[K,V]`, `channel[T]`, `task[T]`, or `range`, resolve to canonical `Map[K,V]`, `Channel[T]`, `Task[T]`, `Range`
- `T[]` already resolves to `Vector[T]` — verify this still works after the rename
- `iter[T]` and `stream[T]` sugar forms: decide whether to keep as sugar or drop entirely (these were never user-facing sugar like `map[K,V]`)

### Step 4 — Update `std/*.pr` files

**Files:** `std/iter.pr`, `std/map.pr`, `std/channel.pr`, `std/task.pr`, `std/range.pr`

- `std/iter.pr`: rename `type iter[T]` → `type Iterator[T]`, `type stream[T]` → `type Stream[T]`
- `std/map.pr`: `type map[K: Hashable + Equal, V]` → `type Map[K: Hashable + Equal, V]` (the file already has both — verify sugar still works)
- `std/channel.pr`: update type references if any use the old canonical name
- `std/task.pr`: update type references if any use the old canonical name
- `std/range.pr`: rename `type range` → `type Range`
- Update any cross-references (e.g., methods returning `Iterator[T]` or `Stream[T]`)

### Step 5 — Update codegen name matching

**Files:** `compiler/internal/codegen/compiler.go`, `compiler/internal/codegen/expr.go`, `compiler/internal/codegen/stmt.go`, `compiler/internal/codegen/mono.go`

- Codegen uses string comparisons against type names (e.g., `named.Name == "map"`, `named.Name == "channel"`). Update all to PascalCase.
- Search for: `"map"`, `"channel"`, `"task"`, `"range"`, `"iter"`, `"stream"` in codegen string comparisons
- Also check `isContainerType()` and `mangleMethodName()` helpers

### Step 6 — Update sema name matching

**Files:** `compiler/internal/sema/check.go`, `compiler/internal/sema/decl.go`, `compiler/internal/sema/info.go`

- Same as Step 5 but in sema: update string comparisons against old lowercase names

### Step 7 — Update ownership name matching

**Files:** `compiler/internal/ownership/checker.go`

- Any type-name string comparisons in ownership analysis must be updated

### Step 8 — Update test helpers

**Files:** `compiler/internal/codegen/codegen_test.go`, `compiler/internal/sema/sema_test.go`, `compiler/internal/ownership/ownership_test.go`

- Update `stdAll` in each test file's `init()` to use PascalCase type names
- Update any test source strings that reference old names
- Run `make resources` to embed updated `std/*.pr`

### Step 9 — Update e2e tests

**Files:** `tests/**/*.pr`

- Search all `.pr` files for old lowercase canonical names used as types
- Note: sugar forms (`map[K,V]`, `channel[T]`, `task[T]`, `T[]`) remain valid — only direct references to canonical names need updating
- `iterator[T]` / `stream[T]` references must become `Iterator[T]` / `Stream[T]`

### Step 10 — Validation

- `make clean && make`
- `go test ./...` (all Go unit tests)
- `promise test ../tests/...` (all e2e tests)
- `bin/e2e.sh` (end-to-end test harness)

## Deferred Work

Known gaps and improvements deferred from completed stages.

### Correctness Bugs

| Item | Origin | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| ~~Reassignment of droppable variable leaks old value~~ — **Fixed.** `genAssignStmt` now calls `emitDropCall` on the old value before storing the new one. Drop flag is checked (moved values skipped) and reset after reassignment. Self-assignment short-circuits. | 8o | ~~Medium~~ Resolved |
| ~~Enqueue-before-suspend race~~ — **Fixed.** Goroutine stores the channel/done mutex in `G.park_mutex` before `coro.suspend`; the scheduler loop releases it in `coroSuspendedBlk` after `coro.resume` returns. Since the waker must acquire the same mutex to dequeue, it blocks until the suspend completes. Verified with stress tests in `tests/concurrency/stress_*.pr`. | 5c | ~~High~~ Resolved |
| ~~Park_m spurious wakeup causing deadlocks~~ — **Fixed.** POSIX `cond_wait` can return spuriously. `park_m` now loops checking `M.spinning` flag (set to 1 by `wake_m` before signaling) and shutdown flag. On spurious wakeup, `M.spinning == 0` → re-wait. Previously, spurious wakeup corrupted the idle M stack (M.p used as both next-pointer and real P association). | 5c | ~~Critical~~ Resolved |
| ~~Select blocking deadlock~~ — **Fixed.** `genSelectStmt` set `park_mutex = null` for blocking select, causing the scheduler to treat it as a yield and immediately re-enqueue. After resume, if no case was ready, code fell through to `mergeBlk` skipping the select. Replaced waiter-list parking with yield-and-retry loop (lockStartBlk). Waiter lists had fundamental enqueue-before-suspend and double-wake races with multiple channel mutexes. | 5c | ~~High~~ Resolved |
| ~~Steal_work data race on thief P queue~~ — **Fixed.** `steal_work` wrote stolen goroutines to the thief's P queue without holding the thief's lock. On ARM64, stores could be reordered, causing queue corruption visible to concurrent stealers. Now locks both thief and victim P's in address order (ptrtoint comparison) to prevent ABBA deadlock. | 5c | ~~High~~ Resolved |
| ~~PHI nodes not grouped in failable destructuring~~ — **Fixed.** `genFailableDestructure` interleaved PHI nodes with alloca/store in the merge block. LLVM requires all PHIs at block top. Reordered to emit both PHIs first, then stores. Affected `(val, err) := failable()` patterns. | 8e | ~~Medium~~ Resolved |

### Codegen Gaps

| Item | Origin | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| Blocking select uses polling (yield-and-retry) instead of waiter-list parking. Correct but spins when no case is ready. Proper fix requires multi-mutex unlock in scheduler or atomic wake-once protocol for select waiters. | 5c | Medium |
| Fire-and-forget goroutine G struct leak: all `go { }` blocks set `result_ptr` to sentinel `0x1`, preventing goroutine_exit from freeing the G. Only `task[T]` should use the sentinel. | 5c | Low |
| Fixed-size arrays as stack-allocated `[N x T]` | 8g | Medium |
| Destructure is-patterns (`x is Dog(name)`) | 8k | Medium |
| Generic type RTTI | 8k | Medium |
| Failable `close()` error propagation in `use` | 8m | Medium |
| Named enum fields in constructors | 8d | Low |
| Enum methods | 8d | Low |
| Extern ABI pack/unpack for enums | 8d | Low |
| Failable extern functions (C ABI for errors) | 8e | Low |
| Type argument inference (explicit type args only currently) | 8f | Low |
| Multi-arg generics in expression context (grammar limitation) | 8f | Low |
| Extern ABI for generic types | 8f | Low |
| Non-instance field placements (`value`/`variant`/`type`) | 8c | Low |
| User type `toString()` for interpolation | 8h | Low |
| Devirtualization optimization (direct call when concrete type known) | 8L | Low |
| ~~`map[bool, T]` — bool key hashing/lookup is broken~~ — **Fixed.** Bool hash now uses hardcoded constants via `select i1` instead of `fnv1a_hash`. Map literal key types are validated against `Hashable + Equal` constraints via `validateConstraints`. | 8i | ~~Medium~~ Resolved |
| ~~Variable name collisions in repeated `if v := opt { }` blocks~~ — **Fixed.** `uniqueLocalName()` with per-function `localNameCount` appends `.N` suffix to duplicate alloca names in inner scopes. | 8n | ~~Medium~~ Resolved |
