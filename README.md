# Promise Programming Language

Statically-typed language designed for AI-agent efficiency. Explicit ownership (like Rust), goroutine-style concurrency (like Go), algebraic errors, generics, exhaustive pattern matching — zero hidden effects. Native LLVM compilation to Linux, macOS, Windows, and WASM.

**Designed for AI agents.** Every design decision optimizes for an AI generating correct, self-contained programs in one shot. Reading a single `.pr` file tells you exactly what it does — no hidden effects, no implicit behaviors, no action-at-a-distance. Types are explicit. Errors are explicit (`?`/`!`). Ownership is explicit (`~`/`&`). Mutability is explicit. There is one obvious way to do things, so code generation is deterministic.

**Mono-versioned catalog.** Promise eliminates dependency hell entirely. There are no per-package versions, no lockfiles, no version resolution. Instead, the entire ecosystem — compiler, standard library, and all catalog modules — ships as a single atomic release called an **epoch** (e.g., `2026.3`). Every module in an epoch is tested together as a unit. Your project declares which epoch it targets in `promise.toml`, and that's it. An AI agent only needs to know the epoch to generate correct imports — no version guessing, no compatibility reasoning, no `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `go.mod` boilerplate.

**Self-contained toolchain.** The compiler is a single Go binary (~61MB release build) that embeds everything: LLVM tools, standard library, catalog modules, and runtime. `promise sync` downloads one file. `promise install` extracts it. No system dependencies beyond a linker. Multiple epochs can coexist side-by-side under `~/.promise/epochs/`.

**Modules without ceremony.** Import a catalog module with `use io;` — no URL, no version, no path. The standard library (`std`) is auto-imported into every file. Catalog modules (`io`, `json`, `os`, `path`, `math`, `strings`, `time`, `http`) are separate compilation units cached as LLVM bitcode for fast incremental builds.

## Example

```
use io "std/io";

type Circle {
  Float radius;

  area(&this) Float `instance {
    return 3.14159 * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

main() {
  Circle c = Circle(radius: 5.0);
  io.print_line("Area: {c.area()}");

  Int[] numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  Int sum = numbers.filter(|n| -> n > 2).fold(0, |acc, n| -> acc + n);
  io.print_line("Sum: {sum}");
}
```

## Key Features

- **Ownership & borrowing** -- Rust-inspired move semantics with `&` (shared borrow), `~` (mutable borrow), and `*` (raw pointer)
- **Algebraic error handling** -- `!` suffix for fallible return types, `?` propagation, pattern-matched error handlers
- **Generics** -- type parameters with constraints: `sort[T is Comparable](T[] items)`
- **Enums with data** -- `enum Option[T] { Some(T value), None }`
- **Pattern matching** -- exhaustive `match` with destructuring, guards, and type patterns
- **String interpolation** -- `"Hello, {name}!"` with arbitrary expressions
- **Goroutine-style concurrency** -- `go expr` returns `Task[T]`, `<-task` to receive
- **Generators** -- `yield` and `yield* iter` for lazy `Stream[T]` production
- **Meta annotations** -- `` `instance ``, `` `static ``, `` `abstract `` for declarative metadata
- **No macros, no conditional compilation** -- all code is fully visible in the source file

## Status

**Stage 8f (current):** The compiler pipeline is functional through code generation. Stages 1–8f are complete:

- **Stages 1–2:** ANTLR4 grammar, CST → AST builder
- **Stages 3–4:** Type system, semantic analysis (type checking, name resolution, exhaustiveness)
- **Stage 5:** Generic type substitution, constraint validation, instance tracking
- **Stage 6:** Ownership analysis (move semantics, borrow tracking, return safety)
- **Stage 7:** Meta annotation processing
- **Stage 8a–8f:** LLVM IR codegen — primitives, strings, user types, enums, error handling, generic monomorphization, containers (tuples, optionals, slices, maps, lambdas), optional patterns, string interpolation, promise-first builtin types

The compiler produces native binaries via LLVM IR + clang. 400+ tests across all packages.

Upcoming stages: module system, package manager.

## Building

Prerequisites: Go 1.22+, Java (for ANTLR4 code generation), clang.

```sh
cd compiler
make              # download ANTLR4 JAR, generate parser, build binary
make test         # run tests
make install      # install to ~/.promise/
make clean        # remove generated code and binary
```

## Usage

```sh
promise build file.pr           # compile to executable
promise build -o out file.pr    # compile with custom output name
promise run file.pr             # compile and run
promise test file.pr            # discover and run @test functions
promise test tests/...          # recursive directory scan
promise check file.pr           # type-check only
promise ast file.pr             # print the AST
```

### Testing options

```sh
promise test -timeout 30s file.pr                    # per-test timeout (default: 60s)
promise test -stress tests/...                       # stress test until Ctrl+C
promise test -stress 100 tests/concurrency/...       # 100 iterations
promise test -stress 30s tests/concurrency/...       # run for 30 seconds
promise test -timeout 10s -stress 50 tests/...       # combine per-run timeout with stress
```

Stress mode compiles all files once, then repeatedly runs the test binaries. It tracks
per-test pass rates and timing variance to detect flaky tests. Stable tests are gradually
suppressed to focus resources on unreliable ones.

### Inline execution

Run Promise code directly from the command line:

```sh
promise exec 'print_line(42)'                        # expression (auto-wrapped in main)
promise exec 'main() { print_line("hello"); }'       # full program
echo 'print_line("hello")' | promise exec            # from stdin
echo 'print_line("hello")' | promise                 # bare pipe (auto-detected)
cat program.pr | promise                              # pipe a file
```

Errors in inline mode show the source line with a caret marker:

```
1:12: undefined: foo
    print_line(foo);
               ^
```

### Install

Install Promise system-wide from a built binary:

```sh
promise install
```

Copies the binary to `~/.promise/bin/` and extracts the embedded standard library and runtime to `~/.promise/lib/`. The binary is self-contained — `std/` and `runtime/` files are embedded at build time via `go:embed`.
