# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Promise is a statically-typed programming language with Dart-inspired syntax and Rust-inspired ownership semantics. The compiler is a single Go binary (`promise`) that uses ANTLR4 for parsing and targets LLVM IR (compiled via `opt` → `.bc` → `ld.lld --lto-O1` on Linux, `opt` → `.bc` → `ld64.lld --lto-O1` on macOS, `opt` → `.bc` → `wasm-ld --lto-O2` on WASM, `opt` → `llc` → `lld-link` on Windows, clang on other platforms).

**Primary goal**: Promise is designed for AI-agent efficiency — making it easy for LLMs to generate correct, self-contained programs in one shot or use them as tools. Every design decision should optimize for:
- **Self-contained readability**: Looking at a single source file should be enough to understand with certainty what it does. Avoid hidden effects, implicit behaviors, and action-at-a-distance.
- **Explicit over implicit**: Prefer explicit types, explicit error handling (`^`/`?`/`!`), explicit ownership (`~`/`&`), explicit mutability. No surprising defaults.
- **Minimal context needed**: An AI agent should be able to generate a correct Promise program without needing to understand a large framework or ecosystem. The standard library should be small, orthogonal, and predictable.
- **One obvious way**: Avoid multiple equivalent ways to do the same thing. Reduce ambiguity in both syntax and semantics so code generation is deterministic.

## Build & Test Commands

**IMPORTANT: Always use `./build` (Linux/macOS) or `.\build.ps1` (Windows) from the repo root to build the compiler. NEVER run `go build` directly — it skips resource embedding and produces a broken binary. The output is `bin/promise` (Linux/macOS) or `bin/promise.exe` (Windows).**

**IMPORTANT: Never commit, push, or create PRs unless the user explicitly asks you to.** Wait for an explicit instruction like "commit", "push", or "create a PR" before performing any git write operations.

**IMPORTANT: Always run `bin/verify.sh --local --wasm` before committing changes.** This formats Go and Promise code, runs `go vet`, and executes the full test suite (including WASM target). The `--local` flag uses a local cache directory to avoid polluting `~/.promise`. Do not commit if verify fails.

**Setup (once per clone):** `bin/setup.sh` — enables git hooks and local dev environment. Also runs automatically on `./build`.

```bash
# From repo root (Linux/macOS):
./build                    # generate parser + embed resources + build → bin/promise
bin/test.sh                # build + run all tests (go + promise)
bin/test.sh go             # Go unit tests only
bin/test.sh promise        # Promise tests only
bin/test.sh --wasm         # include wasm32-wasi target
bin/test.sh --clean        # clear caches first
bin/verify.sh              # format + vet + all tests (pre-commit check)
bin/verify.sh --wasm       # include wasm target
```

```powershell
# From repo root (Windows PowerShell):
.\build.ps1                # embed resources + build → bin\promise.exe
.\build.ps1 -Generate      # also regenerate ANTLR parser (requires Java)
# Prerequisites: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File bin\install-prereqs.ps1
```

The following `make` targets run from `compiler/` and also output to `bin/promise`:

```bash
make                  # download ANTLR4 JAR, generate parser, embed resources, build binary
make release          # release build: embed LLVM tools (~61-71MB self-contained binary)
make test             # run all Go tests (go test ./...)
make generate         # regenerate ANTLR4 parser from grammar
make resources        # copy modules/ into embedded resources
make clean            # remove generated code and binary
```

Go tests run from `compiler/`:

```bash
# Run tests for a single package
go test ./internal/codegen/ -count=1
go test ./internal/sema/ -count=1
go test ./internal/ownership/ -count=1

# Run a single test
go test ./internal/codegen/ -run TestDropBasicScopeExit -v -count=1

# Coverage
go test ./internal/codegen/ -coverprofile=/tmp/cov.out -count=1
go tool cover -func=/tmp/cov.out
```

```

**Test output format** — designed for AI-agent tail-friendliness:

Single-file output (verbose — shows every test with timing):
```
pass (0.001s) test_add
pass (0.002s) test_sub
LEAK (0.001s) test_leaky                       # leak detection — LEAK outcome (T0020)
  leak: 1 allocations not freed                # leak detail on next line
FAIL (0.003s) test_broken
  panic: assertion failed: expected 3, got 4   # panic context shown under FAIL
TIMEOUT (0.100s) test_stuck                    # per-test timeout exceeded (T0023)
  timeout: exceeded 60s limit                  # timeout context
pass (0.001s) test_other                       # subsequent tests still run after panic/timeout

2 passed, 1 failed, 1 leaked, 1 timed out (0.423s)
FAILED:
  test_leaky
  test_broken
  test_stuck
```
Visual hierarchy: `pass` (lowercase) for success, `FAIL`/`LEAK`/`TIMEOUT` (UPPER CASE) for failures. Each failure type has indented context on the next line. Leaked tests are NOT double-counted in passed; timed-out tests are NOT double-counted in failed.

Multi-file output (compact — one line per file):
```
pass (0.004s) e2e/basics.pr (3 tests)         # passing file with test count
pass (0.001s) e2e/hello.pr                    # single-test file (no count)
FAIL (0.005s) e2e/strings.pr (1/3 failed)     # failing file with ratio
  test_split                                   # failed test name
    panic: assertion failed                    # panic context
FAIL (0.000s) broken.pr (compilation error)    # compilation failure
  broken.pr:5:3: type Foo has no field 'bar'   # error context

568 passed, 2 failed, 3 leaked (117 files, 30.810s)
FAILED:                                        # summary with failure context
  e2e/strings.pr: test_split
    panic: assertion failed
  broken.pr (compilation error)
    broken.pr:5:3: type Foo has no field 'bar'
```
An agent can read the last ~20 lines of output to identify all failures without re-running or grepping.

**Stress test output** — reports flaky tests, timing variance, and adaptive scheduling. Crash context (signal, stderr) is captured for diagnosis:
```
=== Stress Test Report ===
Target: linux-x86_64
50 iterations over 45.2s

FLAKY (2 tests):

    test_channel_send              47/50 (94.0%)  avg: 23.1ms  σ: 15.2ms  min: 2.1ms  max: 89.3ms
      1 fail  last: SIGSEGV
      | signal: SIGSEGV
      | stderr:

STABLE: 45 tests across 12 files
```
Stress mode compiles once and re-runs binaries. Stdout and stderr are captured separately — pass/FAIL/LEAK/TIMEOUT lines parsed from stdout, crash context (signal name, exit code, last 20 lines of stderr) from stderr. Stable files are gradually suppressed (run every 2nd/4th/8th iteration). Exit code 1 if any test has failures.

## Compiler Pipeline

```
.pr source → ANTLR4 (grammar/) → AST (ast/) → Sema 4-pass (sema/) → Ownership (ownership/) → LLVM IR (codegen/) → opt+lld(LTO) → binary
```

On Linux/macOS/WASM: `opt -O1` (coroutine lowering + optimization) → `.bc` (LLVM bitcode) → linker with `--lto-O1` (`--lto-O2` for WASM). LTO performs whole-program inlining and DCE across all modules at link time. On Windows: `opt -O1` → `llc -filetype=obj` → `lld-link` (LTO not yet wired up for MSVC). On other platforms (or `PROMISE_USE_CLANG=1`): `clang -O1`. Requires LLVM 22+. Release builds (`./build --release`) embed gzip-compressed LLVM tools in the binary (~61-71MB), extracted lazily to `~/.promise/cache/llvm/<platform>/`. Platform-specific embed files (`llvm_linux_amd64.go`, `llvm_darwin_arm64.go`, `llvm_darwin_amd64.go`) select the correct tools. On macOS, extracted Mach-O binaries are patched with `install_name_tool` (rpath + dylib references) and re-signed with `codesign`.

Entry point: `cmd/promise/main.go` → `compileFrontend()` orchestrates parse → sema (with auto-injected `use std as _`) → ownership.

**Sema 4 passes** (in `sema/check.go`):
1. **Declare** — register all type/enum/func names in scope
2. **Define** — resolve parent types, fields, method signatures
3. **Check** — type-check all function/method bodies
4. **Verify** — return path analysis

**Ownership** runs after sema: move tracking, borrow conflicts, return safety.

**Codegen** (`codegen/compiler.go`): AST + sema info → LLVM IR module. Handles monomorphization of generics, RTTI for inheritance, vtable dispatch, scope cleanup (use/drop bindings).

## Key Architecture Concepts

**Four-struct type layout**: Each user type generates up to 4 LLVM structs — Type (static), Instance (heap fields), Value (`{vtable_ptr, instance_ptr}`), and Variant (enum payload). Value structs are passed around; instance ptrs are what methods receive as `this`. **Pure value types** (all fields `` `value ``): Value struct is `{vtable_ptr, field1, field2, ...}` with data embedded directly — no heap allocation, no RTTI pointer in the value struct (RTTI is accessed via the compile-time-known `promise_rtti_T` global). Instance struct is a global RTTI-only singleton. Automatically `` `copy ``, no `is` parents, no `drop()`. See `layout.go:computeValueTypeLayout()`.

**Scope cleanup stack**: `scopeBindings` is a LIFO stack of `bindingClose` (use vars), `bindingDrop` (droppable vars), `bindingDropEnum` (enum vars with droppable variant data, T0102), and `bindingFreeEnv` (closure env structs). Emitted in reverse at scope exit, return, raise, break, continue. Drop bindings have an `i1` drop flag that's cleared at move sites. Enum drop bindings pass the alloca pointer (bitcast to i8*) to the synthesized enum drop function, which switches on the tag and drops variant-specific fields. Env free bindings null-check the env pointer before calling `free()`.

**String literals** (T0060): String literals are emitted as complete instance structs in `.rodata` — zero malloc, zero memcpy per literal evaluation. Instance layout: `{ i8* _variant, i64 len, [N x i8] data }`. Bit 63 of the `len` field is the **literal flag**: set for .rodata literals, clear for heap-allocated strings. All length reads use `loadStringLen()` which masks off bit 63 via `and i64 %raw, 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`. `loadStringLenRaw()` preserves the flag for literal detection. `promise_string_drop` checks bit 63 before calling `pal_free` (not yet activated — string drop requires ownership integration, tracked as T0061). The `get is_literal bool` native getter on `string` exposes the flag. Design decision: per-instance flag chosen over .rodata pointer detection because it's equally fast (~1ns), 100% portable (no linker scripts/platform code), and 100% reliable (no ASLR/LTO/section-merge dependencies). Long-term direction: type-level static/heap distinction (Rust `&str`/`String` model) to eliminate the runtime flag entirely (T0063).

**Vector literals** (T0062): Vector literals with all compile-time constant elements (int, float, bool, char literals) are stored as `.rodata` globals — zero malloc per literal evaluation. Layout: `{ i64 len|bit63, i64 cap, [N x T] data }`. Bit 63 of `len` is the **static flag** (same pattern as T0060 for strings). All vector length reads use `loadVectorLen()` which masks off bit 63. `Vector.drop` checks bit 63 before calling `pal_free`. Mutation operations (push, pop, remove, index assign, slice assign) use **copy-on-write**: `promise_vector_cow()` checks bit 63 and copies to heap if static, then stores back the new pointer. COW is inserted at call sites (not inside runtime functions) so the caller's variable is updated. Non-constant elements (variables, function calls) fall back to the heap allocation path.

**Closures/lambdas**: All function values use fat pointer `{ i8*, i8* }` (fn ptr + env ptr). Lambda functions always take `i8* %env` as first parameter. Capture analysis in sema (`checkLambdaCapture`) detects outer-scope variable references; `Copy` types auto-captured, non-`Copy` requires `move`. Nested captures propagate through intermediate lambdas. Named function references use thunks (`.thunk.name`) to adapt to env-first ABI. Env structs are heap-allocated via `malloc` and freed via `bindingFreeEnv` at scope exit. **Env struct layout** (B0221): `{ i8* env_drop_fn, capture0, capture1, ... }`. Field 0 is a pointer to a per-closure env drop function (or null if no captures need dropping). The env drop function drops each captured value (strings via `promise_string_drop`, vectors via `Vector.drop`, channels via `Channel.drop`, closure envs recursively, heap user types via `pal_free`/drop) then frees the env struct itself. All cleanup sites (`cleanupEnvTemps`, `emitEnvFree`, `__promise_iter_cleanup`) load field 0 and call it if non-null, else fall back to `pal_free`. `this` captures in default methods are skipped (borrowed, not owned).

**Monomorphization** (`codegen/mono.go`): Generic types and functions are specialized at codegen time. The pipeline has three phases for each module compilation:

**1 — Collect**: Gather all concrete instantiations transitively from sema info.
- `collectMonoInstances(info)` → `[]*types.Instance` — deduplicates by mangled name (`monoName(inst)` → `"Box__int__string"`), then transitively expands: (a) walks each instance's substituted field types via `discoverInstances`, (b) walks parent types (e.g., `Range[int] is Stream[T]` → adds `Stream[int]`), (c) resolves _unresolved instances_: sema type-checks generic method bodies once with TypeParams unbound, recording e.g. `_FnIter[T]` (with `TypeParam` embedded) in `info.Types`; `collectUnresolvedInstances` finds these, and `resolveUnresolvedInstances` applies the current concrete substitution to produce `_FnIter[int]`.
- `collectMonoFuncInstances(info, typeInstances)` / `collectMonoMethodInstances(info, typeInstances)` — deduplicate `FuncInstance` and `MethodInstance` records, then resolve _unresolved_ instances (those whose `TypeArgs` contain `TypeParam`). These arise when a generic function/method body calls another generic function/method using the outer's type parameter (e.g., `wrap[T]` calling `identity[T]`). Resolution uses substitution maps from: (a) concrete type instances (for generic type methods calling generic functions), (b) concrete func/method instances of the same kind (transitive self-resolution for chains like `a[T]→b[T]→c[T]`). After both are collected, `crossResolveFuncMethodInstances` performs bidirectional cross-resolution: FuncInstance substs resolve unresolved MethodInstances and vice versa (e.g., `invoke[T]` calling `e.echo[T]`).
- **Cross-module — `collectMonoInstancesWithExtra(modInfo, modFile, extra)`**: seeds the transitive expansion with the module's own `modInfo.SemaInfo.Instances` PLUS any extra `*types.Named`-origin instances from user code whose type name appears in `modFile`'s declarations. Unresolved-instance expansion uses `modInfo.SemaInfo` so method-body type references (e.g., `_FnIter[T]` inside `Vector[T].iter()`) resolve against the module's types. Note: only `*types.Named` extras are filtered in this way — generic enum instances from user code are not propagated via the extra path.
- **`collectMonoFuncInstancesWithExtra` / `collectMonoMethodInstancesWithExtra`**: same pattern — filter extra instances by whether the function/owner-type name is in `modFile`'s declarations. Unresolved extras (containing TypeParams) are skipped.

**2 — Declare**: Create LLVM struct layouts and function stubs.
- `computeMonoLayouts(instances)` — for each `*types.Named` instance with TypeParams, produces 4 LLVM structs with all field types substituted via `types.Substitute(f.Type(), subst)`. The exact layout depends on kind:
  - **Heap user type**: `_t` (Type, empty `{}`), `_m` (Variant, `{T_t* _type}`), `_i` (Instance, `{T_m* _variant, field1, field2, ...}`), `_v` (Value, `{i8* _vtable, T_i* _instance}`)
  - **Value type** (all fields `` `value ``): same `_t`/`_m`, but `_i` is RTTI-only `{T_m* _variant}` with no user fields, and `_v` embeds fields directly: `{i8* _vtable, field1, field2, ...}` (no RTTI pointer — accessed via `promise_rtti_T` global)
  - For `*types.Enum` instances: `computeMonoEnumLayout` produces `_t`/`_m`/`_i` (RTTI-only) plus `_v` as `{i8* _vtable, T_i* _instance, i32 tag, [maxDataSize x i8] data?}` with per-variant data structs.
- `emitMonoVtableGlobals(instances)` — creates immutable `[N x i8*]` vtable globals (`promise_vtable_Box__int`). Called at two points in the overall compile sequence: first in the main codegen phase **before** `compileModules()` (module-owned functions not yet declared → some slots are `null`), then again **inside** each `compileModule()` call. The second call **updates** the existing global's `Init` field with newly available function pointers rather than skipping — this is the critical fix for module-owned generic types.
- `emitMonoTypeInfoGlobals(instances)` — creates immutable typeinfo globals (`promise_typeinfo_Box__int`) with layout `{i8* vtable_ptr, i8* drop_fn_ptr, i32 typeID, i32 numParents, [N x i32] parentIDs}`. `drop_fn_ptr` (B0226) points to the type's drop function (or null), enabling runtime drop dispatch for untyped error catches. TypeID is assigned from `c.nextTypeID++`. For value types, also emits a global RTTI instance (`promise_rtti_Box__int`).
- `declareMonoMethods(file, instances)` — creates LLVM function stubs for non-generic methods on each `*types.Named` instance (e.g., `Box__int.foo`). Skips structural types (their default methods are synthesized separately). Skips generic methods (`len(md.TypeParams) > 0`, handled by `declareMonoMethodInstances`). Also verifies the found TypeDecl matches the exact `*Named` origin to prevent name collisions between user types and std types.
- `declareMonoSynthesizedDefaults(file, instances)` — declares stubs for default methods inherited from structural interfaces. Delegates to `declareStructuralDefaultStubs` which skips methods the concrete type already defines, skips abstract methods, and recurses into transitive structural parents. These stubs are NOT registered in `moduleOwnedFuncs` (they live in the main IR even when declared inside a `compileModule` call).
- `declareMonoFuncs(file, funcInsts)` / `declareMonoMethodInstances(file, methodInsts)` — declare stubs for generic free functions and generic methods. Both register `c.moduleOwnedFuncs[name] = c.compilingModule` when `c.compilingModule != ""`.
- All declare functions guard against re-declaration: `if _, exists := c.funcs[name]; exists { continue }`.

**3 — Define**: Generate function bodies with type substitutions active.
- `defineMonoMethods`: sets `c.typeSubst = subst` and `c.monoCtx = &monoContext{inst, origin, name}`, calls `defineMethodFunc` (or `defineGeneratorMethod` for generator methods). Cleans up via deferred `c.typeSubst = nil; c.monoCtx = nil`.
- `defineMonoSynthesizedDefaults` → `defineStructuralDefaultBodies`: uses `c.saveState()` / `c.restoreState(saved)` for full context save, sets `c.selfSubst = &selfSubstInfo{iface, concrete}` so the interface's `Self` resolves to the concrete type inside the default method body. Recurses into structural parent chains.
- `defineMonoFuncs` / `defineMonoMethodInstances`: set `c.typeSubst` (and optionally `c.monoCtx` for method instances on generic owner types), call `defineFunc` / `defineGeneratorFunc` / `defineMethodFunc`.
- All define functions guard against re-definition with `if !ok || len(fn.Blocks) > 0 { continue }` — essential in the module-internal test path where module sources are merged into the main file, which would otherwise cause both the module phase and main phase to append bodies to the same function → malformed IR.

**Naming**: `monoName(inst)` → `"Map__string__int"` (type args joined by `__`). `monoFuncName(fi)` → `"sort__int"`. `monoMethodInstanceName(mi)` → `"Box__int.transform__string"` (owner mono name + `.` + method name + `__` + method type args). Name encodes the full nested arg tree: `Map[string, Vector[int]]` → `"Map__string__Vector__int"`. Setter methods use a `$set` suffix: `mangleMethodName(name, "[]", true)` → `"Box__int.[]$set"`.

**Type substitution across inheritance**: `mergeParentSubst(named, subst)` augments a substitution map with mappings for inherited type params — resolves parent type args under the current subst, builds a parent sub-map, adds it to `subst`, then recurses for the parent's own parents. `buildMethodInstanceSubst(mi)` starts from owner type-level subst (if `OwnerInst != nil`) + `mergeParentSubst` + method type-level subst, producing a single map that covers all type params visible inside a method body.

**Module separation + caching**: After codegen, `SplitModuleIRs()` assigns functions to module IRs using `moduleOwnedFuncs[name] = moduleName`, registered during the declare phase when `c.compilingModule != ""`. Note that synthesized structural default method stubs are NOT registered (they always stay in the main IR). Module IRs are compiled to `.bc` (LTO) or `.o` and cached. The cache key includes a FNV-128a hash of the **module IR text** (not just source hash), making it sensitive to which mono instances are present — two user programs importing the same module but using different generic instances get separate cache entries. String constants use `LinkagePrivate` so each split `.bc` (module, instance) contains its own copy — no cross-module extern references for strings. Per-module names (`@.str.__mod_std.N`, counter reset to 0 at each `compileModule()` start) remain stable within a module compilation. LTO deduplicates identical private globals at link time.

**Per-instance `.bc` caching**: Each generic type instantiation (`Box__int`, `Vector__string`, etc.) gets its own cached LLVM bitcode file, keyed by `InstanceCacheKey(irPrefix, monoName, typeDeclHash, compilerHash, target)`. The `typeDeclHash` is a FNV-128a hash of the *entire* TypeDecl/EnumDecl AST (fields, method signatures + bodies, annotations, type params, inheritance) computed by `HashTypeDecl`/`HashEnumDecl` in `sema/typehash.go` and stored in `sema.Info.DeclHashes map[*types.TypeName]string`. The cache key changes whenever the type definition changes, but not when unrelated declarations in the same file change. Before codegen, `lookupCachedInstances` checks the build cache for each instance and returns a `map[string]bool`; `CompileWithCache(…, cachedInstances)` skips body generation for cached instances while still registering them in `instanceOwnedFuncs` so `SplitModuleIRs` strips them correctly. After codegen, a pre-cached loop in `compileAndLinkSeparate` loads pre-cached `.bc` files directly (since `InstanceIRs()` only returns instances whose bodies were actually generated). Instance `.bc` files contain only their own function bodies; vtable/typeinfo definitions stay in the main IR (referenced as `extern declare` in instance BCs). `InstanceIRs()` extracts per-instance IR slices by temporarily stripping non-owned function bodies using `saveAndStripNonOwnedInst`.

**M:N Scheduler** (`codegen/sched.go`): GMP model — G (goroutine/LLVM coroutine), P (processor with 256-slot ring buffer run queue), M (OS thread via `pal_thread_create` with explicit 2MB stack — musl defaults to 128KB). Coroutine block structure: `coro.start` (coro.begin + captured-param allocas + entry-block allocas via `createEntryAlloca`) → `br coro.init.suspend` → `coro.init.suspend` (initial coro.suspend + switch to body/cleanup/suspend). The separate `coro.init.suspend` block ensures allocas precede the suspend point so `coro-split` can spill them to the coroutine frame. Key concurrency invariants:
- **Park mutex protocol**: Goroutines store the channel/done mutex in `G.park_mutex` before `coro.suspend`. The scheduler unlocks it after `coro.resume` returns. This prevents enqueue-before-suspend races — the waker must acquire the same mutex, blocking until suspend completes.
- **park_mutex = null means yield**: The scheduler re-enqueues the goroutine (cooperative preemption). park_mutex != null means park — the goroutine is on a waiter list and will be woken by another goroutine.
- **Select blocking uses SelectWaiterNode (SWN) parking**: Each select case gets a stack-allocated SWN (G-layout-compatible at fields 0–4, field 1=0xFF sentinel). SWNs are enqueued on channel waiter lists; a per-select mutex (stored in each SWN and in G.park_mutex) provides wake-once semantics. `select_try_wake` CAS's `G.select_case` under the select mutex. Channel send/recv/close use `promise_waiter_wake_one` which handles both regular G and SWN nodes. On resume, the goroutine locks all channels, removes remaining SWNs, and dispatches on `G.select_case`.
- **Park_m spurious wakeup protection**: `park_m` loops on `cond_wait` checking `M.spinning` flag (set by `wake_m` before signaling). Prevents spurious wakeups from corrupting the idle M stack. On exit, `park_m` only restores `M.p` (saved P pointer) when `spinning=1` (deliberately woken by `wake_m`). When woken by shutdown (`spinning=0`), `M.p` retains the idle-list next pointer — restoring it would corrupt the idle stack for concurrent `wake_m` callers (B0120).
- **Shutdown signal/join**: `promise_sched_shutdown` uses `max_p` (not `num_p`) for its signal and join loops, ensuring Ms on disabled Ps (after `set_max_procs` reduced `num_p`) are still signaled and joined. After joining all M threads, joins the sysmon thread (handle stored in `sched.sysmon_handle`, field 19), then destroys all mutexes/conds (per-P lock, per-M park_mutex/park_cond, scheduler-global locks) and frees M allocations and the P array. Fully deterministic shutdown — no reliance on process-exit cleanup.
- **Work stealing lock order**: `steal_work` locks both thief and victim P's in address order (ptrtoint comparison) to prevent ABBA deadlock between concurrent stealers.
- **Waiter lists**: Intrusive linked list via `G.wait_next` (field 4). Protected by channel mutex. `promise_waiter_enqueue/dequeue/remove/wake_all/wake_one` helpers in sched.go. Lists can contain both regular G nodes and SelectWaiterNode (SWN) entries — `wake_one` and `wake_all` check field 1 (0xFF sentinel) to distinguish.
- **Sysmon**: Background thread sets `G.preempt=1` every 10ms; yield checks at loop back-edges call `coro.suspend`.
- **Stack overflow detection** (B0010): Guard page via `pthread_attr_setguardsize(4096)` on each M's 2MB stack. macOS uses `sigaction(SA_ONSTACK)` + per-thread `sigaltstack(64KB)` for reliable delivery, prints "fatal: stack overflow". Linux uses `sigaction(SA_SIGINFO | SA_ONSTACK)` + per-thread `sigaltstack(64KB)` with libc-aware struct layouts (glibc 152-byte vs musl 40-byte sigaction), reads `si_addr` from `siginfo_t` and prints "fatal: segmentation fault at 0x\<hex\>" with the fault address (B0128). Handler registered at startup (`pal_stack_overflow_init`); per-thread alt stack set up at `sched_loop` entry (`pal_stack_overflow_thread_init`).

**Standard library**: 38 `.pr` files in `modules/std/` compiled as a regular embedded catalog module and auto-imported into every file via `use std as _`. Catalog modules (`modules/io/`, `modules/path/`, `modules/math/`, `modules/strings/`, `modules/os/`, `modules/time/`, `modules/http/`) are separate compilation units with their own `promise.toml`. Runtime is codegen-emitted LLVM IR (no C runtime). See `docs/standard-library.md` for the full module inventory, PAL extensions, and implementation phases.

## Test Patterns

Tests use helper functions that build a mini standard library (`stdAll`) with all primitive type declarations, then parse + sema + codegen user code:

```go
// codegen tests
ir := generateIR(t, `
    type Foo { int x; }
    main() { f := Foo(x: 1); }
`)
assertContains(t, ir, "call void @Foo.drop")

// sema tests
errs := checkErrs(t, `type Bad { drop(this) {} } main() {}`)
expectError(t, errs, "must take ~this")

// ownership tests
ownerOK(t, `type R { int id; drop(~this){} } test() { r := R(id:1); }`)
errs := ownerErrs(t, `...`)
expectOwnerError(t, errs, "use of moved variable")
```

Methods must be declared inside the type body (for types) or after variants (for enums). Numeric literals infer as `int`/`f64` — use typed parameters for i8/i16/i32/f32 tests.

## Standard Library & Catalog Modules

The standard library (`modules/std/`, 37 files) is auto-imported via `use std as _` into every file. Catalog modules (`modules/<name>/`) are separate compilation units imported explicitly with `use <name>;`.

## Implementation Philosophy

- **Prefer Promise over IR**: When adding new standard library functionality (e.g., container methods, operators), implement in the Promise language (`modules/std/*.pr`) rather than generating custom LLVM IR in codegen. Only use `native` methods when direct memory access or runtime calls are unavoidable (e.g., `Vector.push`, `Vector.[]`, string byte access). Non-native methods written in Promise are type-checked by sema, monomorphized automatically, and far easier to maintain.
- **Test at every level**: Significant changes need both Go unit tests (`codegen_test.go`, `sema_test.go`) AND Promise-level e2e tests (`tests/` directory, run via `promise test`). Go tests verify IR shape; Promise tests verify runtime correctness.
- **No hidden effects**: When designing language features, avoid implicit side effects, hidden control flow, or magic behaviors. Every effect should be visible at the call site. If a function can fail, it must be marked failable (`!`). If a value is consumed, it must be moved (`~`). If a variable is mutable, it must be declared so.
- **Self-contained by default**: Design features so that programs are understandable in isolation. Avoid global state, implicit initialization, and ambient context. A reader (human or AI) should be able to read a `.pr` file top-to-bottom and know exactly what it does without consulting external docs or hidden configuration.
- **NEVER work around language/compiler/test-infra issues.** When implementing standard library or catalog modules and you hit a language limitation, compiler bug, codegen issue, or test infrastructure problem — **stop and file a bug in the `tracker` MCP server** (type: `bug`). Do NOT hack around the issue in module code (e.g., restructuring code to avoid a parser bug, adding redundant casts to dodge a type-checker gap, duplicating logic because a feature is missing). The language and platform are designed to fully support module implementation — if something doesn't work, that's a real bug that needs a real fix. Let the user implement the compiler/infra fix; your job is to identify and document the blocker clearly.

## Writing Promise Code

- **Always add `` `doc `` annotations on `` `public `` declarations.** Promise's `` `doc `` annotation attaches documentation to types, methods, and functions in the AST. When writing Promise code — especially anything marked `` `public `` — always include a `` `doc `` annotation so AI agents can understand the API without reading implementation details.

- **Prefer batch tests over snapshot tests.** Promise has two test styles:
  - **Batch tests** — functions tagged `` `test `` using `assert()`. All test functions in a file (and across files passed together) compile into a **single binary**, making them significantly faster. This is the preferred style.
    ```
    add() `test {
      assert(1 + 1 == 2);
      assert(3 + 4 == 7);
    }
    ```
  - **Snapshot tests** — `main()` tagged `` `test(expected: "...") ``. Each file compiles into its **own binary** and the stdout output is compared against the expected string. Use only when testing exact program output matters (e.g., print formatting, REPL-style verification).
    ```
    main() `test(expected: "hello world") {
      println("hello world");
    }
    ```
  The cost of running tests is dominated by how many binaries are compiled — test execution itself is practically instant. Batch tests minimize binary count.

  Both styles support a `timeout` annotation parameter for per-test timeout control: `` `test(timeout: "5s") `` or `` `test(expected: "...", timeout: "2s") ``. Duration uses Go syntax (`500ms`, `2s`, `1m`). Tests without a timeout annotation use the CLI `-timeout` default (60s). The CLI also supports `-timeout-scale`, `-timeout-min`, `-timeout-max` to modify all timeouts uniformly.

  **Memory leak enforcement** (T0067): Tests that leak memory (alloc count delta > 0) cause test failure. **ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY: The repo has 0 leaks and 0 `allow_leaks` tags. Any leak is a regression. Never add `allow_leaks: true` to any test. Never treat any leak as preexisting. Changes that introduce memory leaks will not be pushed.**

- **Co-locate tests with source files.** Place `*_test.pr` files alongside the `.pr` files they test (not in a separate `tests/` tree). This makes tests easier to find and maintains context. The `tests/` directory is for cross-cutting integration and e2e tests that don't belong to a specific module or file.

- **Use full English words in APIs — with approved abbreviations.** All public names in the standard library and language APIs must use complete, unabbreviated words (e.g., `print_line` not `println`, `make_directory` not `mkdir`, `concatenate` not `concat`, `execute` not `exec`). **Exception:** An explicit abbreviation dictionary (see §9.3a in `docs/language-design.md`) defines universally preferred short forms — when a mapping exists (e.g., `dir` ← `directory`, `env` ← `environment`, `id` ← `identifier`, `arg` ← `argument`, `attr` ← `attribute`, `ch` ← `character`, `src` ← `source`, `init` ← `initialize`, `len` ← `length`, `millis` ← `milliseconds`, `config` ← `configuration`, `info` ← `information`, `func` ← `function`, `dest` ← `destination`, `pos` ← `position`, `prev` ← `previous`, `var` ← `variable`, `min`/`max`/`abs`), the abbreviation is mandatory. This optimizes for AI-agent readability while avoiding identifiers that look silly when fully expanded.

- **Use getters for side-effect-free parameterless access.** Any public function or module-level function that takes no arguments and has no side effects should be a getter (`get name Type`), not a function (`name() Type`). Getters are accessed as properties without parentheses (e.g., `os.hostname`, `os.process_id`, `os.env`). Only use a function when the operation has side effects (e.g., `receive_signal()` blocks on I/O) or takes parameters.

## Bug & Task Tracking

**All bugs, tasks, and deferred items are managed via the `tracker` MCP server.** The tracker auto-assigns IDs by type: `B0001` for bugs, `T0001` for tasks, `D0001` for deferred items. These IDs are stable and can be referenced from code comments, commit messages, and conversations.

- **Filing bugs:** Use `mcp__tracker__create` with `type: "bug"`. Include a clear title, description (what the bug is, any workaround), priority, and relevant tags (e.g., `codegen`, `parser`, `ownership`, `formatter`, `scheduler`).
- **Filing tasks:** Use `type: "task"` for planned work items. Use `type: "deferred"` for items that are not yet scheduled.
- **Querying:** Use `mcp__tracker__list` to filter by type, status, priority, or tag. Use `mcp__tracker__search` for free-text search.
- **Updating:** Use `mcp__tracker__update` to change status (`open` → `in_progress` → `done`/`wontfix`), add notes, or update priority.
- **Reference in code:** Use tracker IDs in code comments (e.g., `// B0030: workaround for optional user type in constructor`) and commit messages.
- **`docs/archive/stages.md`** is the archived implementation roadmap. All open bugs/tasks/deferred items have been migrated to the `tracker` MCP server, which is the sole source of truth for status.

## Conventions

- **Document workarounds immediately.** When you encounter a compiler bug, language limitation, or missing feature, file it in the `tracker` MCP server right away (type: `bug`). Include: what the bug is, any workaround, and the priority. Do not leave undocumented workarounds in the code.
- Compiler errors are accumulated (not fatal on first error) and printed together
- `extractNamed(typ)` unwraps Instance/SharedRef/MutRef to get underlying `*types.Named`
- `needsVtable(named)` returns true if type has children or is abstract → virtual dispatch
- `mangleMethodName(owner, name, failable)` produces LLVM function names like `TypeName.method`
- Move sites must call `clearDropFlag(name)` — there are 8 call variant sites in expr.go plus assignment sites in stmt.go
- All tests must pass after changes. Significant changes need accompanying tests.
- When updating `modules/std/*.pr`, run `./build` — it automatically embeds the updated stdlib. The `stdAll` mini-stdlib in test files is auto-populated from the embedded std via `go:embed` — no manual update needed.
